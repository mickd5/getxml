Not only is Buzz a superhero with neato gadgets that amaze the others; he is also a really nice toy, eager to help the othersEveryone likes him, except for poor usurped Woody, who hates playing second fiddleIf Buzz has one Achilles heel, it is that he doesn't realize that he is a toyAlthough Woody initially tries to accept Buzz, his resentment begins to build up until, desperate to regain his favored position with Andy, Woody "accidentally" pushes Buzz out of the windowIn the toys' world there is no place more fearful than the outdoorsSure enough nasty neighbor Sid has a penchant for blowing up toys with firecrackers and using the shattered parts to make monstrous creations that might even scare director Tim BurtonSoon after the incident, basically good-hearted Woody begins feeling guilty and decides he must save Buzz from certain destructionHe and the other toys set out to find him and end up on a riotous, exciting chase to save their friend.(n)</desc>

Not only is Buzz a superhero with neato gadgets that amaze the others; he is also a really nice toy, eager to help the othersEveryone likes him, except for poor usurped Woody, who hates playing second fiddleIf Buzz has one Achilles heel, it is that he doesn't realize that he is a toyAlthough Woody initially tries to accept Buzz, his resentment begins to build up until, desperate to regain his favored position with Andy, Woody "accidentally" pushes Buzz out of the windowIn the toys' world there is no place more fearful than the outdoorsSure enough nasty neighbor Sid has a penchant for blowing up toys with firecrackers and using the shattered parts to make monstrous creations that might even scare director Tim BurtonSoon after the incident, basically good-hearted Woody begins feeling guilty and decides he must save Buzz from certain destructionHe and the other toys set out to find him and end up on a riotous, exciting chase to save their friend.(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Richard Hammond is in Abu Dhabi to drive a new hybrid sports car from Porsche. It is called the 918 and it combines a 4.6-litre V8 petrol engine with a pair of electric motors to create an 886 horsepower, four-wheel drive supercar sensation. Plus, Clarkson and James May are tasked with shooting a public information film to promote safer cycling. And Clarkson is also the judge for a hot hatchback showdown between the latest iteration of the legendary Volkswagen Golf GTI and a powerful, rear-wheel-drive pretender from BMW called the M135i. Finally, there is an American in the Reasonably Priced Car as Aaron Paul, star of Breaking Bad and Need For Speed, tries his hand in the Astra out on the test track. Richard is in Abu Dhabi to drive the 886 bhp Porsche 918 Spyder around the Yas Marina F1 circuit. Stig also drives the Porsche and the McLaren P1 around the Top Gear track: if he can&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; set a faster lap time for the Porsche, Jeremy has promised to change his name to Jennifer.&lt;/span&gt;.(n)</desc>
