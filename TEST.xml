		<desc lang="en">Director Joe Carnahan's big-screen take, co-produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, on the 80s TV series, which was an OTT action-fest that, at the same time, gloried in and poked fun at its tough-guy stars and their adventures. This time around, a little brasher and more serious than their first incarnation, the team of soldiers comprises the cigar-chomping Col 'Hannibal' Smith, the wilfully eccentric Murdock, toned babe-magnet Face and, of course, BA Baracus, who famously 'pities the fool', usually with more forceful fisticuffing than is strictly necessary. Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar. And, of course, blowing up as many objects as possible along the way. Also featuring Jessica Biel as Face's former flame and Patrick Wilson as the team's CIA handler(n)</desc>

Things go badly wrong for Richard the Lionheart and his men during their return from crusade in the Holy Land. One of the King's soldiers who escapes with his life is archer Robin Longstride, who adopts the persona of the recently slain Robin of Loxley in order to get back to the safety of England.

Phil and Claire Foster feel their marriage has gone a tad stale and decide to pep it up by going out on a date, just like they used to do, before the kids and the mortgage and rest of life's inevitable distractions got in the way. In principal it's a good idea, but their first mistake is to attempt entry into one of Manhattan's swankiest restaurants without a reservation. Their second is far more serious: they bluff their way in, pretending to be a couple who have failed to show up for their table. Unfortunately for the Fosters, the absent diners have serious gangland connections. Even more unfortunately, the people whose identities they've adopted are due to be silenced forever by Mob hitmen. Cue a tightly plotted, gag-packed, headlong flight for survival, which has distinct echoes of the classics of the 40s screwball genre. And keep an eye out for memorable cameos from Mark Wahlberg and James Franco(n)</desc>

Decades after a nuclear war, a lone man calling himself Eli trudges through the dilapidated cities and scorched wilderness of America, carrying his copy of the Bible, a sacred book that provides 'contentment for the weak-minded'. On an odyssey to bring the text to a sacred place, Eli brings God's wrath down on the robbers, murderers and rapists who lie in wait along the highways. Driven by faith and divine calling, Eli's endeavour becomes harder when he meets the power-hungry Carnegie, who tutors an army of psychopathic rogues and gunmen in a small town. Hoping to steal the book he believes is his last chance to rule what is left of humanity, Carnegie sets out to catch Eli, while Carnegie's step-daughter also follows Eli on his quest. As Carnegie and his henchmen hunt Eli down, they soon discover what a powerful and fearsome adversary he really is(n)</desc>

Derek Thompson is an ice hockey pro whose main tactical use is the flattening of opponents - often depriving them of a tooth or two in the process. His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist in reality, he's in for a bit of a shock. Unknown to him they do - and they take great umbrage at his slight. Thompson is whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's tried for his misdemeanour and sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. Thus he sprouts wings, is furnished with an outfit completely at odds with his usual image and is given Tracy as a (none too willing) mentor. And, as the comedic misunderstandings and slapstick errors steadily mount, it's clear Thompson wasn't cut out for his new line of work(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970)</title>
		<desc lang="en">After the intense bloodshed of The Wild Bunch (1969), this comic western fable took the opposite approach to director Sam Peckinpah's continuing examination of the end of the West. Left for dead by a couple of lizard-slaughtering desperados in the middle of the desert, prospector Cable Hogue (Jason Robards) is saved by his unexpected discovery of water "where there wasn't any". Hogue turns the water hole, felicitously located near a stagecoach route, into a thriving business, creating a rest stop for a never-ending series of parched travelers. On his occasional trips to the closest town, he meets chipper prostitute Hildy (Stella Stevens), who joins him in his oasis, completing Hogue's little paradise. But even though Hogue may be able to succeed and avenge himself against his original attackers, there is one thing that he cannot stop: progress. Completed before The Wild Bunch was released, and replete with comical and even musical interludes, Peckinpah's gently picaresque telling of Hogue's rise and fall stands in distinct contrast to the visual violence of its predecessor. The underlying message about the cost of modernity, however, equals The Wild Bunch in seriousness. The callous randomness of Hogue's fate is as shocking as the Bunch's final blaze of glory; as in Robert Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller from the same period, a tool of "civilization" provokes a most uncivilized end for an Old West dreamer. Although the film was as light-hearted in approach as the 1969 smash hit revisionist western Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Warner Bros. mishandled the release and it did barely any business; Peckinpah returned to his trademark gore in his next film, the controversial Straw Dogs (1971). Still, The Ballad of Cable Hogue is less an anomaly for a master of violence than an ironically charming chapter in Peckinpah's career-long elegy to the western(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">An epic of miniature proportions, this stunning film combines state of the art computer animation with a fun and fantasy filled adventure from the team that made Toy Story. It's a small world on Ant Island, populated with every imaginable kind of bug, but the adventures are anything but small. Each summer a bunch of greedy grasshoppers descends demanding food, which the peace-loving ants grudgingly supply. Then one year a rebel ant called Flik decides to enlist the help of an unemployed troupe of bug performers from a second rate flea circus to fight the intruders. It's a great idea, but doesn't quite work out the way he planned.... Star voices include Kevin Spacey and the late Roddy McDowall in this great family film. Ant-icipate enjoyment!(n)</desc>
