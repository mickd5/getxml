In principal it's a good idea, but their first mistake is to attempt entry into one of Manhattan's swankiest restaurants without a reservation. Their second is far more serious: they bluff their way in, pretending to be a couple who have failed to show up for their table. Unfortunately for the Fosters, the absent diners have serious gangland connections. Even more unfortunately, the people whose identities they've adopted are due to be silenced forever by Mob hitmen. Cue a tightly plotted, gag-packed, headlong flight for survival, which has distinct echoes of the classics of the 40s screwball genre.

Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar. And, of course, blowing up as many objects as possible along the way. Also featuring Jessica Biel as Face's former flame and Patrick Wilson as the team's CIA handler(n)</desc>

Derek Thompson is an ice hockey pro whose main tactical use is the flattening of opponents - often depriving them of a tooth or two in the process. His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist in reality, he's in for a bit of a shock. Unknown to him they do - and they take great umbrage at his slight. Thompson is whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's tried for his misdemeanour and sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. Thus he sprouts wings, is furnished with an outfit completely at odds with his usual image and is given Tracy as a (none too willing) mentor. And, as the comedic misunderstandings and slapstick errors steadily mount, it's clear Thompson wasn't cut out for his new line of work(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">I, Robot (2004)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Set just three decades in the future, Alex Proyas's all-action science fiction film is inspired by Isaac Asimov's 1950s short story. The science of robotics is so advanced that humanoid-looking servants have been developed, ready to obey any command from a human. When the chief designer of US Robotics, the biggest manufacturer of this new brand, is found dead in the company's atrium after a fall from the upper floor, it has all the hallmarks of suicide, and Chicago cop Del Spooner is assigned to the case. But, because of a previous trauma, Spooner is a technophobe and doesn't believe that all robots are harmless. Despite opposition from both his superiors and the company, he investigates further and soon his suspicions centre on one robot, Sonny (voiced by Alan Tudyk). Is "he" one of an army of conscious, violent robots ready to challenge their human masters?(n)</desc>
