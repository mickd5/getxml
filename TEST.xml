		<title lang="en">Big Trouble in Little China (1986)</title>
		<desc lang="en">John Carpenter takes a rest from the horror genre to direct this enjoyable martial arts romp that's played firmly with its tongue in cheek. Kurt Russell plays Jack Burton, who agrees to pick up a friend's girlfriend from the airport. But when Miao Yin is kidnapped in front of him, Burton finds she's been abducted by sorcerer Lo Pan, the host of the spirit of an ancient Chinese warlord. He wants her for her unique green eyes, rare among Chinese women, to rejuvenate his spirit, and Burton has just hours to track down his lair and free Yin. With nods to the Indiana Jones trilogy, Carpenter enjoys setting up one exciting, exotic set piece after another while Russell wisely reprises the all-action, wise-cracking Snake Plissken from Escape from New York to enjoyable effect(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Predator (1987)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Dutch has a code of honor which he will not violate, even when his life depends on it. Paradoxically, his code of honor gives him the backbone to survive as a military special forces operative when he is sent on a covert mission to rescue another group which was sent in to assist some nefarious U.S. government plan in a Latin American country. Once there, he encounters an old army buddy who has gotten too deep in the CIA's good graces for Dutch's comfort. When he and his team go into the jungle to rescue the others, they get involved in a pitched battle with local guerillas, but they are more than capable of besting these vicious fighters. However, not long after that, they encounter signs that the equally capable men they were sent to rescue were all killed unawares and in an unusually gruesome fashion. Given their training, it should have been impossible for anyone to best all of these commando warriors. Soon, the men from Dutch's own team get picked off one by one, as they grow aware that they are up against something uncanny, not of this world, something that is hunting them for sport. Why? Because their skills make them worthy opponents for the perfectly camouflaged Predator(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Post-apocalyptic action about a solitary warrior who fights to protect the last known copy of a powerful book. Decades after a nuclear war, a lone man calling himself Eli trudges through the dilapidated cities and scorched wilderness of America, carrying his copy of the Bible, a sacred book that provides 'contentment for the weak-minded'. On an odyssey to bring the text to a sacred place, Eli brings God's wrath down on the robbers, murderers and rapists who lie in wait along the highways. Driven by faith and divine calling, Eli's endeavour becomes harder when he meets the power-hungry Carnegie, who tutors an army of psychopathic rogues and gunmen in a small town. Hoping to steal the book he believes is his last chance to rule what is left of humanity, Carnegie sets out to catch Eli, while Carnegie's step-daughter also follows Eli on his quest. As Carnegie and his henchmen hunt Eli down, they soon discover what a powerful and fearsome adversary he really is(n)</desc>

Mills' life hasn't panned out well; his dedication to the CIA wrecked his marriage and made him neglect his daughter Kim. Now, retired from the Agency, he wants to make things up to Kim. But to do so, he has to contend with his ex-wife's animosity and Kim's new step-father's wealth.

The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>

Derek Thompson is an ice hockey pro whose main tactical use is the flattening of opponents - often depriving them of a tooth or two in the process. His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist in reality, he's in for a bit of a shock. Unknown to him they do - and they take great umbrage at his slight. Thompson is whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's tried for his misdemeanour and sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. Thus he sprouts wings, is furnished with an outfit completely at odds with his usual image and is given Tracy as a (none too willing) mentor. And, as the comedic misunderstandings and slapstick errors steadily mount, it's clear Thompson wasn't cut out for his new line of work(n)</desc>
