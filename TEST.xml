The orphaned and enslaved Conan grows to become Arnold Schwarzenegger, vowing vengeance on Thulas Doom (James Earl Jones), the slayer of his family. En route, he picks up the requisite strange companions before confronting Doom and, in the process, saving the captured princess (Valerie Quennessen) whose father is suitably grateful. Possibly not the most cerebral of films but rollicking good stuff all the same(n)</desc>
