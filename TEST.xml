And, not willing to stop there, Brüno decides to jet off to the Middle East to solve the Arab/ Israeli conflict - to the utter horror of both parties, and risking injury or worse himself. Opinions are divided over whether Brüno is out to expose the idiocy of homophobia, or whether he's simply using it for laughs.

This time around, a little brasher and more serious than their first incarnation, the team of soldiers comprises the cigar-chomping Col 'Hannibal' Smith, the wilfully eccentric Murdock, toned babe-magnet Face and, of course, BA Baracus, who famously 'pities the fool', usually with more forceful fisticuffing than is strictly necessary. Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar. And, of course, blowing up as many objects as possible along the way. Also featuring Jessica Biel as Face's former flame and Patrick Wilson as the team's CIA handler(n)</desc>

Derek Thompson is an ice hockey pro whose main tactical use is the flattening of opponents - often depriving them of a tooth or two in the process. His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist in reality, he's in for a bit of a shock. Unknown to him they do - and they take great umbrage at his slight. Thompson is whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's tried for his misdemeanour and sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. Thus he sprouts wings, is furnished with an outfit completely at odds with his usual image and is given Tracy as a (none too willing) mentor. And, as the comedic misunderstandings and slapstick errors steadily mount, it's clear Thompson wasn't cut out for his new line of work(n)</desc>

It turns out that while his mum Sally (Catherine Keener) is human, his father (Kevin McKidd) is the Greek god of the sea and earthquakes, Poseidon; which makes our hero a demigod. At first it's all a bit much to take in, as he learns the modern world is teeming with deities and their offspring. And things take a turn for the worse when Zeus (Sean Bean) suspects Percy of theft after the lightning bolt that confers supreme, terrifying power goes missing. With his mother kidnapped and the errant super weapon threatening to cause a catastrophic clash of the gods, Percy sets off to recover the artefact. As he does so, he discovers the many creatures and monsters of legend are also alive today, and are as fierce as ever. Also starring Pierce Brosnan (as a centaur), Uma Thurman (as Medusa) and Steve Coogan (as Hades)(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Ben-Hur (1959)</title>
		<desc lang="en">William Wyler's famed, multi-Oscar-winning, epic Biblical extravaganza stars Charlton Heston and features, literally, a cast of thousands. It's the tale of Jewish prince Judah Ben-Hur, who, refusing to betray his people, is in turn betrayed by a friend from his past, Messala. Stripped of his privileged life and his family, he is condemned to the gruelling existence of a galley slave. Eventually rescued by a Roman nobleman, Ben-Hur is propelled on a trajectory that will see him cross paths with Jesus Christ on several occasions, as well as reunite with his beloved mother and sister, and get the chance to confront Messala on more equal terms. But, of course, it's the lavish spectacle that lodges in the viewers' memory, particularly the thrilling chariot race sequence; the massive, purpose-built set for which, jam-packed with extras, went quite some way to making this film more expensive than any prior to it. However, there was ample recompense for the investment: it garnered an as-yet unbeaten 11 Oscars (subsequently equalled only by Titanic and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King), including the Lead Role award for Heston and Best Director for Wyler(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Footloose (1984)</title>
		<desc lang="en">(1984) Herbert Ross's musical romance stars Kevin Bacon as Ren McCormack, a teenager who moves from Chicago to a small town where, to his horror, he discovers rock music and dancing are outlawed at the behest of preacher Shaw Moore (John Lithgow), who blames the death of his daughter on the devil's music. And to complicate matters, Ren falls for Moore's surviving daughter Ariel (Lori Singer), who is not as innocent as she seems. As Ren tries to persuade Moore that rock music isn't the root of all evil, a confrontation with both his daughter and the more bigoted members of his congregation give him food for thought in this classic feel-good film.

In 1963, "Baby" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) is a 17-year-old spending the summer with her family at a resort hotel in the Catskills; she plans on being in the Peace Corps next summer, so this is expected to be her last summer as a carefree adolescent. Baby doesn't get along with her older sister, Lisa (Jane Brucker), and she's bored to tears by most of the older guests at the resort. However, one night Baby hears what sounds like a party going on in the employee's dormitory, and she pokes her head in to discover most of the hotel staff enjoying the sort of close dancing that would get you kicked out of the senior prom in no time flat. Baby is particularly struck by handsome Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), a dancer in the resort's floor show, and falls head over heels in love, wanting to be near him. Dirty Dancing was a surprise box-office hit, and the soundtrack album was an even bigger success, spawning several hit singles. Starring Patrick Swayze, Jennifer Grey &amp; Jane Brucker(n)</desc>
