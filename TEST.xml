		<title lang="en">Date Night (2010)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Tina Fey and Steve Carell star in Shawn Levy's chase comedy. Phil and Claire Foster feel their marriage has gone a tad stale and decide to pep it up by going out on a date, just like they used to do, before the kids and the mortgage and rest of life's inevitable distractions got in the way. In principal it's a good idea, but their first mistake is to attempt entry into one of Manhattan's swankiest restaurants without a reservation. Their second is far more serious: they bluff their way in, pretending to be a couple who have failed to show up for their table. Unfortunately for the Fosters, the absent diners have serious gangland connections. Even more unfortunately, the people whose identities they've adopted are due to be silenced forever by Mob hitmen. Cue a tightly plotted, gag-packed, headlong flight for survival, which has distinct echoes of the classics of the 40s screwball genre. And keep an eye out for memorable cameos from Mark Wahlberg and James Franco(n)</desc>

Derek Thompson is an ice hockey pro whose main tactical use is the flattening of opponents - often depriving them of a tooth or two in the process. His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist in reality, he's in for a bit of a shock. Unknown to him they do - and they take great umbrage at his slight. Thompson is whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's tried for his misdemeanour and sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. Thus he sprouts wings, is furnished with an outfit completely at odds with his usual image and is given Tracy as a (none too willing) mentor. And, as the comedic misunderstandings and slapstick errors steadily mount, it's clear Thompson wasn't cut out for his new line of work(n)</desc>

Aaron Green (Hill) works for a record company run by the increasingly unhinged Sergio (Sean Combs) and is a huge fan of the British rock star Aldous Snow (Brand, reprising his role from Forgetting Sarah Marshall). Sergio and Green hatch a plan for Snow to play, in just three days' time, Los Angeles's revered venue the Greek Theatre. Getting Snow from London to LA, via New York and Vegas, should be a doddle. But he's just fallen off the wagon, and the sleazy rocker's appetite for drink, drugs and attractive women complicate the journey so much that it's not clear whether Green will survive the rock star's hedonism. In addition to Combs' superbly energetic turn, Rose Byrne shines as Jackie Q, a role that satirises the record industry's fondness for marketing its female artists as sexual commodities. Also starring Elisabeth Moss, Colm Meaney and a host of real-life music icons(n)</desc>

Icarus II (Icarus I, the previous attempt, went missing years after launch) is captained by Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada), with Capa (Cillian Murphy), a physicist, and Corazon (Michelle Yeoh) in charge of the ship's environment. But as Icarus II approaches Mercury, it begins to receive signals from Icarus I, and when they board the supposedly lost craft, they encounter an entity that endangers the whole mission.

Two young Marines stand accused of murdering a member of their platoon during an unsanctioned disciplinary action known as a "Code Red". The Navy, in an effort to obtain a quick and quiet plea bargain, appoints Lieutenant J.G.Daniel Kaffee, a young, second generation Navy lawyer, to defend the accused Marines. Less than fifteen months out of Harvard Law School, Kaffee has earned a reputation for his glibness and facility to plea bargain. Though possessed of a brilliant legal mind Kaffee is more interested in softball games than in the hardball game of law. At first the game appears routine: On the U.S. Naval Base located at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, two Marines conduct a seemingly unauthorised punishment on a fellow Marine who has broken the chain of command by writing a letter to an off-base authority, threatening to report one of them for an illegal shooting over the fenceline in exchange for a transfer(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">A Few Good Men (1992)</title>
		<desc lang="en">"A Few Good Men" is based on the successful Broadway drama, a critically acclaimed story of a Navy lawyer's unrelenting quest to uncover the truth during a military trial. Two young Marines stand accused of murdering a member of their platoon during an unsanctioned disciplinary action known as a "Code Red". The Navy, in an effort to obtain a quick and quiet plea bargain, appoints Lieutenant J.G.Daniel Kaffee, a young, second generation Navy lawyer, to defend the accused Marines. Less than fifteen months out of Harvard Law School, Kaffee has earned a reputation for his glibness and facility to plea bargain. Though possessed of a brilliant legal mind Kaffee is more interested in softball games than in the hardball game of law. At first the game appears routine: On the U.S. Naval Base located at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, two Marines conduct a seemingly unauthorised punishment on a fellow Marine who has broken the chain of command by writing a letter to an off-base authority, threatening to report one of them for an illegal shooting over the fenceline in exchange for a transfer(n)</desc>
