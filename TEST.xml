		<title lang="en">The A-Team (2010)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Director Joe Carnahan's big-screen take, co-produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, on the 80s TV series, which was an OTT action-fest that, at the same time, gloried in and poked fun at its tough-guy stars and their adventures. This time around, a little brasher and more serious than their first incarnation, the team of soldiers comprises the cigar-chomping Col 'Hannibal' Smith, the wilfully eccentric Murdock, toned babe-magnet Face and, of course, BA Baracus, who famously 'pities the fool', usually with more forceful fisticuffing than is strictly necessary. Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar. And, of course, blowing up as many objects as possible along the way. Also featuring Jessica Biel as Face's former flame and Patrick Wilson as the team's CIA handler(n)</desc>

Ben Stiller plays high school geek Ted, invited to the prom by the gorgeous Mary. He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private eye Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Tooth Fairy (2010)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Dwayne Johnson stars in Michael Lembeck's family fantasy comedy about a tough-guy sportsman who learns the hard way not to puncture a child's illusions. Derek Thompson is an ice hockey pro whose main tactical use is the flattening of opponents - often depriving them of a tooth or two in the process. His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist in reality, he's in for a bit of a shock. Unknown to him they do - and they take great umbrage at his slight. Thompson is whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's tried for his misdemeanour and sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. Thus he sprouts wings, is furnished with an outfit completely at odds with his usual image and is given Tracy as a (none too willing) mentor.

Two young Marines stand accused of murdering a member of their platoon during an unsanctioned disciplinary action known as a "Code Red". The Navy, in an effort to obtain a quick and quiet plea bargain, appoints Lieutenant J.G.Daniel Kaffee, a young, second generation Navy lawyer, to defend the accused Marines. Less than fifteen months out of Harvard Law School, Kaffee has earned a reputation for his glibness and facility to plea bargain. Though possessed of a brilliant legal mind Kaffee is more interested in softball games than in the hardball game of law. At first the game appears routine: On the U.S. Naval Base located at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, two Marines conduct a seemingly unauthorised punishment on a fellow Marine who has broken the chain of command by writing a letter to an off-base authority, threatening to report one of them for an illegal shooting over the fenceline in exchange for a transfer(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Jerry Zucker's fantasy story stars Patrick Swayze as Sam Wheat and Demi Moore as Molly Jensen. He's killed in an apparent random mugging, leaving her heartbroken. But when it transpires he was murdered to stop him exposing a major fraud, Molly's in danger because the incriminating information is in her possession. Sam's ghost, still earthbound, finds out that the only way to warn her is through Oda Mae Brown, a fake medium who suddenly finds she's his channel to the living. A mix of comedy, thriller and romance (throwing a pot will never be the same again) coupled with outstanding special effects have turned this into an enduring, enjoyable classic(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">"A Few Good Men" is based on the successful Broadway drama, a critically acclaimed story of a Navy lawyer's unrelenting quest to uncover the truth during a military trial. Two young Marines stand accused of murdering a member of their platoon during an unsanctioned disciplinary action known as a "Code Red". The Navy, in an effort to obtain a quick and quiet plea bargain, appoints Lieutenant J.G.Daniel Kaffee, a young, second generation Navy lawyer, to defend the accused Marines. Less than fifteen months out of Harvard Law School, Kaffee has earned a reputation for his glibness and facility to plea bargain. Though possessed of a brilliant legal mind Kaffee is more interested in softball games than in the hardball game of law. At first the game appears routine: On the U.S. Naval Base located at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, two Marines conduct a seemingly unauthorised punishment on a fellow Marine who has broken the chain of command by writing a letter to an off-base authority, threatening to report one of them for an illegal shooting over the fenceline in exchange for a transfer(n)</desc>

Mike has enjoyed France so much he's gone native (growing a little moustache and dressing like a French man) and doesn't want to leave. On the plane, we learn Molly is excited to get home and start their life together as a married couple, but Mike wants to travel the world. Molly wants to get back because she thinks Joyce, Victoria and Vince will have run amok without her there and Mike thinks Carl has probably fallen apart without him. As they're flying back, there's turbulence and scares the wanderlust out of Mike. Meanwhile, at home, Joyce, Victoria and Vince have enjoyed getting to do what they want and Carl has a "man-crush" on his temp partner who is uber-masculine(n)</desc>

When her mother remarries, Bella Swan relocates to the state of Washington to live with her father Charlie. There, in the small, perpetually wintry town of Forks, she starts her new life, though she has no inkling of quite how different it's going to be. At her new school she quickly establishes herself as both a bit of a klutz and a hunk magnet. However, she's not interested in most of the guys - apart from the moodily handsome, ashen complexioned Edward Cullen. And when he saves her from various threatening situations, their mutual attraction is sealed. There's just one tiny problem: he's a vampire. But although Edward and his undead family are 'vegetarians' who don't feed on humans, his breed find it very difficult to control their overwhelming desire for human blood when their emotions switch from love to lust..(n)</desc>
