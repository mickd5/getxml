		<title lang="en">The A-Team (2010)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Director Joe Carnahan's big-screen take, co-produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, on the 80s TV series, which was an OTT action-fest that, at the same time, gloried in and poked fun at its tough-guy stars and their adventures. This time around, a little brasher and more serious than their first incarnation, the team of soldiers comprises the cigar-chomping Col 'Hannibal' Smith, the wilfully eccentric Murdock, toned babe-magnet Face and, of course, BA Baracus, who famously 'pities the fool', usually with more forceful fisticuffing than is strictly necessary. Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar. And, of course, blowing up as many objects as possible along the way. Also featuring Jessica Biel as Face's former flame and Patrick Wilson as the team's CIA handler(n)</desc>

Icarus II (Icarus I, the previous attempt, went missing years after launch) is captained by Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada), with Capa (Cillian Murphy), a physicist, and Corazon (Michelle Yeoh) in charge of the ship's environment. But as Icarus II approaches Mercury, it begins to receive signals from Icarus I, and when they board the supposedly lost craft, they encounter an entity that endangers the whole mission. Sunshine is written by Alex Garland, who also collaborated with Boyle on 28 Days Later. M,W,R,S,(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Liam Neeson stars as former CIA operative Bryan Mills, who's desperate to track down his kidnapped daughter in Pierre Morel's Luc Besson-produced action-thriller. Mills' life hasn't panned out well; his dedication to the CIA wrecked his marriage and made him neglect his daughter Kim. Now, retired from the Agency, he wants to make things up to Kim. But to do so, he has to contend with his ex-wife's animosity and Kim's new step-father's wealth. So when he has an opportunity to advance Kim's pop star ambitions he jumps at the chance, even if that means her and a friend crossing the Atlantic to brave 'the dangers of Europe'. As things turn out, he has a point: in Paris, the two girls are kidnapped by vicious Eastern European sex traffickers. As they are being abducted, Bryan tells one of the baddies, via Kim's mobile phone: 'I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you'. He subsequently does his best to make good on his promise, using all the violent tricks of the trade his time at the CIA taught him(n)</desc>

Desde las cavernas hasta la era espacial nos gusta la comida para llevar. Mientras que las hamburguesas y las papas fritas son los reyes de la comida rápida, la comida para llevar ha llegado a niveles de sofisticación mas allá del auto servicio. El charqui permitió a los exploradores conocer nuevas fronteras y las barras proteicas de ahora, llevan al límite nuestros cuerpos. Desde la comida en campos de batalla hasta las fronteras lejanos del espacio, la comida siempre ha estado a mano para llevar. Te invitamos a esta cuenta regresiva de la comida rápida que nos pasea por pasado, nos impulsa al futuro, y a veces, (no nos olvidemos de las famosas galletas de la fortuna), revelan nuestro destino(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Toda idea comienza con una chispa, pero algunas crecen y logran cambiar al mundo. La necesidad es la madre de la invención. Desde la oscuridad el hombre busca la luz y comienza usando una simple vela; de un lugar alguien quiere comunicarse a la distancia y nace la idea del teléfono. Pero algunos inventos transformaron la vida más allá de nuestros hogares: la máquina a vapor, el telescopio, y el internet todo cambia nuestra vida. En esta cuenta regresiva veremos como la inventiva llega de todas formas y maneras. Algunos nacieron con un sencillo uso, como el martillo, mientras que otros desafiaron los límites que no creían posibles, como el avión. Pero sin importar el porcentaje de inspiración o transpiración por cada invento, nos han cambiado la vida para siempre(n)</desc>

Pero cuando el destino y la historia se combinan, hasta el objeto más sencillo, se infunde de relevancia histórica. Un trocito de roca es solamente eso hasta que nos dicen que es de la Luna, y entonces, se convierte en un salto para la humanidad. Una guitarra es solamente una guitarra pero si nos dicen que es tocando una guitarra que pertenecía a Jimmy Hendrix, entonces estas tocando una generación, no a una caja de madera con cuerdas . Algunos objetos son únicos en su especie (la máscara mortuória del Rey Tutankhamen) y otros son universales (un anillo de bodas), y todos nos afectan muy personalmente a cada quien.
