In Pop Goes the Easel, Moe, Larry and Curly were joined by Stooges regulars Phyllis Crane and Bobby Burns, as well as newcomer Elinor Vanderveer, a statuesque dowager type who had already survived several on-screen confrontations with Laurel and Hardy comedies. Larry, Moe and Curly are looking for work, but a shopkeeper accidentally thinks they are thieves, resulting in the police chasing after them. They end up in an art studio and are mistaken for art students.(n)</desc>

Moe, Larry and Curly played unlikely Englishmen arriving in the New World and getting in trouble with a band of increasingly hostile Indians. A great deal of this short subject consisted of leftover footage from the earlier Whoops, I'm an Indian! (1936).

		<desc lang="en">World War II was just heating up, but the U.S. hadn't yet entered the fighting when the Three Stooges made this comic short. It opens with the boys selling greeting cards on the street, none too successfully. One surly guy in particular is a victim of the Stooges' harassment. To get away from his wrath, the boys dash into an apartment building, where they find a weepy young woman who thinks her husband doesn't love her anymore. To help her out, the Stooges offer to try to make her husband jealous. The woman's spouse turns out to be the very same man they harassed a few minutes earlier. To get away from him -- again -- the guys get in what they think is a bread line, but it's really a recruitment line for the Army. In a flash the Stooges are in uniform -- only to discover that their sergeant is the very same angry husband. They manage to make it through basic training and are sleeping through bomb blasts when they're woken up and sent on a mission. The sergeant has been captured and they're supposed to bomb enemy headquarters with laughing gas. Naturally, the gas shell explodes on them and they're captured. At the enemy headquarters, they manage to knock everyone unconscious while laughing uncontrollably. The place is being shelled by the American troops, and the Stooges, still laughing, ride one of the shells as it soars out of the building. The Stooges mistakenly join the Army when they are running from a jealous husband, that the Stooges were hired to make jealous. Ironically, once they are in the Army, the jealous husband turns out to be&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; their new Sergeant. They are sent to war and are accidently gassed by their own laughing gas bomb. The enemy captured them and the Stooges let them have it when they are still dopped up on all the gas.&lt;/span&gt;.(n)</desc>

Unfortunately, Carrie's latest Lothario is not all that he says he is, as she later discovers when she meets his boss...at his house, where she ends up with Keith after the party. However, this deception is nothing compared to the bomb Charlotte (Kristin Davis) drops on her friends when she unexpectedly shows up in L.A.: her marriage to Trey (Kyle MacLachlan), she confesses, is a sexless hoax.

		<desc lang="en">Hopelessly stranded on the remote shores of Madagascar, the New Yorkers hatch a plan to get back to Central Park that instead finds them soaking up sun in the picturesque plains of AfricaMadagascar may be a nice place to visit, but for the gang of animals who spent most of their lives in New York, there is truly no place like homeAfter discovering the remnants of a crashed airplane, the penguins quickly set about making the repairs needed to get the craft airborne againWhen the plane finally takes to the sky, it begins to look like it's only a matter of time before Alex the Lion (voice of Ben Stiller) and friends are soaring over New York HarborUnfortunately the penguins weren't the aviation experts they claimed to be, and before long the crew is coming in for a crash-landing in the untamed plains of AfricaNow, as the animals reared in the safety of the zoo come into contact with their decidedly wild counterparts for the very first time, they get a better feel for their roots while marveling over the differences between life in the concrete jungle and life on the world's second largest continentOf course, while there's plenty to love about wandering the open plains, romantic rivalries and the risk of running into dangerous poachers soon begin to outweigh the joys of some long-overdue family reunionsWith some particularly heavy cases of homesickness causing hearts to weigh heavy, the group gradually starts to wonder whether they'll ever find their way back homeChris Rock, David Schwimmer, Jada Pinkett Smith, Sacha Baron Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer, and Andy Richter lend their voices to this animated sequel that re-teams original Madagascar co-directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath.(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">A paraplegic ex-marine finds a new life on the distant planet of Pandora, only to find himself battling humankind alongside the planet's indigenous Na'vi race in this ambitious digital 3D sci-fi epic from Academy Award-winning Titanic director James CameronThe film, which marks Cameron's first dramatic feature since 1997's Titanic, follows Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a war veteran who gets called to the depths of space to pick up the job of his slain twin brother for the scientific arm of a megacorporation looking to mine the planet of Pandora for a valued oreUnfortunately the biggest deposit of the prized substance lies underneath the home of the Na'vi, a ten-foot-tall, blue-skinned native tribe who have been at war with the security arm of the company, lead by ColMiles Quaritch (Stephen Lang)Because of the planet's hostile atmosphere, humans have genetically grown half-alien/half-human bodies which they can jack their consciousnesses into and explore the world inSince Jake's brother already had an incredibly expensive Avatar grown for him, he's able to connect with it using the same DNA code and experience first-hand the joys of Pandora while giving the scientific team, led by Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and Norm Spellman (Joel David Moore), some well-needed protection against the planet's more hostile forcesOn a chance meeting after getting separated from his team, Jake's Avatar is rescued by Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a Na'vi princess, who brings him into her tribe in order to give the humans a second chance at relating to this new environmentWhen word gets out of his increasing time with the alien species, Quaritch enlists Jake to do some reconnaissance for the company, as they'd like to persuade the tribe to move their home before taking more drastic measures to harness the treasure hidden belowYet as Jake becomes one with the tribe and begins to understand the secrets of Pandora, his conscience is torn between his new adopted world and the wheelchair-bound one awaiting him when the psychic connection to his Avatar is brokenSoon battle lines are drawn and Jake needs to decide which side he will fight on when the time comesThe film was shot on the proprietary FUSION digital 3D cameras developed by Cameron in collaboration with Vince Pace, and offers a groundbreaking mix of live-action dramatic performances and computer-generated effectsThe revolutionary motion-capture system created for the film allows the facial expressions of actors to be captured as a virtual camera system enables them to see what their computer-generated counterparts will be seeing in the film, and Peter Jackson's Oscar-winning Weta Digital visual-effects house supervises Avatar's complex special effects.(n)</desc>

		<sub-title lang="en">Ragtime Band</sub-title>
		<desc lang="en">Lucy (Lucille Ball) volunteers Ricky's band to perform for a Westport Historical Society fundraiser, assuming that he'll say yes when he finds out. Ricky (Desi Arnaz) finds out, all right, but the answer is no. Undaunted, Lucy organizes her own band, with herself on saxophone, Fred (William Frawley) on fiddle, Little Ricky (Richard Keith) on drums, and Ethel (Vivian Vance) as vocalist. This hilarious episode contains one of those endearing continuity gaffs so beloved of I Love Lucy buffs, as Lucy reveals that the only song she knows how to play is "She'll Be Coming' Round the Mountain" -- negating the information imparted in the second-season episode "The Saxophone," wherein Lucy's repertoire consisted solely of "Glow Worm.".(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Lucy (Lucille Ball) wants to return to New York for a fancy dinner and a Broadway show. As luck would have it, the Ricardos and the Mertzes have managed to get four tickets for the sold-out Frank Loesser musical +The Most Happy Fella. Unfortunately, those tickets are only for a matinee performance, and only two balcony tickets are available for the evening show. Not wishing to be deprived of their "big evening," Lucy and Ethel (Vivian Vance) hit upon a brilliant idea: the girls will use the tickets to watch the first act of +The Most Happy Fella, then exchange their ticket stubs with Ricky (Desi Arnaz) and Fred (William Frawley) so that the boys can enjoy Act Two. Well...it seemed like a brilliant idea at the time....(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Examining a potential link between Earth's pyramids and otherworldly beings. For thousands of years, pyramids were the largest structures on Earth. The best known were constructed in Egypt and Central America, but others have been found all around the world, including in China, Africa and Indonesia.&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; But what purpose did the pyramids serve? Researchers explore strange similarities between all pyramids, as well as the geographic, strategic and otherworldly connections between these mysterious monumental structures.&lt;/span&gt;.(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Examining a theory that aliens helped ancient rulers rise to power. Powerful monarchs ruling by divine right. Centuries-old dynasties amassing enormous wealth. And legendary leaders wielding powerful weapons of mass destruction. Is it possible that ancient rulers were, in fact, connected with divine or, some would say,&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; extraterrestrial forces? Ancient Astronaut theorists posit that these great rulers were "chosen" and guided by extraterrestrials - and perhaps shared a common genetic trait, a so-called "leadership gene". And might this gene have been–not a product of genetic evolution–but inherited by mankind from some otherworldly source? Investigating the possible connections between powerful rulers in the past and extraterrestrial forces - and asking the question : was history manipulated by aliens?&lt;/span&gt;.(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">An unresponsive toddler with a temperature of 108 suffers organ failure; will multiple amputations save her? Plus, doctors leave a 13" blade in a man's gut. 10/10. A little girl's health begins to deteriorate when she suddenly comes down with a fever. She then develops reddish spots on her body, stops breathing on her own, and even suffers kidney and liver failure. A&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; spinal tap reveals that the little girl has meningococcal disease. A home contractor has been relatively healthy, until he suddenly begins to gain weight in his abdominal area, which turns out to be caused by a large tumor. After removal of the tumor, the man feels excruciating pain that spreads from his abdomen to his lower back and chest. Initially, it appears to be part of his recovery process, but an x-ray shows that a retractor has been left in his body after the surgery. A young baseball star's life is turned upside down when he starts experiencing a fever, headache, and vomiting. Doctors suspect the little boy may have meningitis, but as he deals with seizures, it turns out that he actually has amoebic encephalitis.&lt;/span&gt;.(n)</desc>
