But he's not only greeted with gratitude, he's also unexpectedly invited to continue living his double life, including cohabiting with Loxley's widow, the strong, independent Marion. It may look as though he's landed on his feet, but there's a dark cloud on the horizon in the form of the slippery, villainous Sir Godfrey - who is simultaneously out to squeeze more taxes from the population to fund the playboy lifestyle of Prince John, while also treacherously laying the ground for a second French invasion of Britain(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones return to reprise their roles in Barry Sonnenfeld's sci-fi action-comedy sequel about the agency that keeps Earth's human inhabitants blissfully oblivious to the pervasive existence of aliens. The film opens as homicidal extraterrestrial Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escaping a 40-year incarceration in a secret high-security prison on the moon. Freshly liberated, Boris sets out for long-brooded-upon revenge on Agent K who shot off his arm when he was captured. Time-travelling to the late 1960s, Boris intends to avoid his amputation, wipe Agent K from history and lead Earth's invasion by his race. Thus Agent J must also head back in time to prevent his friend's younger self from meeting an untimely death and the rest of us from being conquered... With Emma Thompson as Agent O, J and K's boss, and Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin, J's alien sidekick, who's capable of seeing every possible outcome in every situation(n)</desc>
