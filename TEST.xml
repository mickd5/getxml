		<title lang="en">Secretary (2002)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Maggie Gyllenhaal plays a shy woman recently discharged from a mental institution into the care of her dysfunctional family. Searching for work, she takes a lowly clerical job with dour, demanding attorney James Spader. Critical of her mistakes, one day, verbal abuse crosses to physical, as he spanks her. But she seems to thrive on his treatment and a reciprocal relationship begins until Spader, finding she enjoys the humiliation, fires her. Bereft, and with her boyfriend Jeremy Davies unable to fulfil her desires, she plans to win back Spader's affections. Steven Shainberg's film could have been crudely exploitative but thanks to the delicacy of his treatment, the subtlety of the two central performances, plus a leavening of humour, this is a story of unconventional love but love for all that(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Director Joe Carnahan's big-screen take, co-produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, on the 80s TV series, which was an OTT action-fest that, at the same time, gloried in and poked fun at its tough-guy stars and their adventures. This time around, a little brasher and more serious than their first incarnation, the team of soldiers comprises the cigar-chomping Col 'Hannibal' Smith, the wilfully eccentric Murdock, toned babe-magnet Face and, of course, BA Baracus, who famously 'pities the fool', usually with more forceful fisticuffing than is strictly necessary. Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar. And, of course, blowing up as many objects as possible along the way. Also featuring Jessica Biel as Face's former flame and Patrick Wilson as the team's CIA handler(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Maggie Gyllenhaal plays a shy woman recently discharged from a mental institution into the care of her dysfunctional family. Searching for work, she takes a lowly clerical job with dour, demanding attorney James Spader. Critical of her mistakes, one day, verbal abuse crosses to physical, as he spanks her. But she seems to thrive on his treatment and a reciprocal relationship begins until Spader, finding she enjoys the humiliation, fires her. Bereft, and with her boyfriend Jeremy Davies unable to fulfil her desires, she plans to win back Spader's affections. Steven Shainberg's film could have been crudely exploitative but thanks to the delicacy of his treatment, the subtlety of the two central performances, plus a leavening of humour, this is a story of unconventional love but love for all that(n)</desc>

Once there, he encounters an old army buddy who has gotten too deep in the CIA's good graces for Dutch's comfort. When he and his team go into the jungle to rescue the others, they get involved in a pitched battle with local guerillas, but they are more than capable of besting these vicious fighters. However, not long after that, they encounter signs that the equally capable men they were sent to rescue were all killed unawares and in an unusually gruesome fashion. Given their training, it should have been impossible for anyone to best all of these commando warriors. Soon, the men from Dutch's own team get picked off one by one, as they grow aware that they are up against something uncanny, not of this world, something that is hunting them for sport. Why?

In principal it's a good idea, but their first mistake is to attempt entry into one of Manhattan's swankiest restaurants without a reservation.

Unfortunately for the Fosters, the absent diners have serious gangland connections. Even more unfortunately, the people whose identities they've adopted are due to be silenced forever by Mob hitmen.

		<desc lang="en">Dwayne Johnson stars in Michael Lembeck's family fantasy comedy about a tough-guy sportsman who learns the hard way not to puncture a child's illusions. Derek Thompson is an ice hockey pro whose main tactical use is the flattening of opponents - often depriving them of a tooth or two in the process. His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist in reality, he's in for a bit of a shock. Unknown to him they do - and they take great umbrage at his slight. Thompson is whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's tried for his misdemeanour and sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. Thus he sprouts wings, is furnished with an outfit completely at odds with his usual image and is given Tracy as a (none too willing) mentor. And, as the comedic misunderstandings and slapstick errors steadily mount, it's clear Thompson wasn't cut out for his new line of work(n)</desc>

It turns out that while his mum Sally (Catherine Keener) is human, his father (Kevin McKidd) is the Greek god of the sea and earthquakes, Poseidon; which makes our hero a demigod. At first it's all a bit much to take in, as he learns the modern world is teeming with deities and their offspring. And things take a turn for the worse when Zeus (Sean Bean) suspects Percy of theft after the lightning bolt that confers supreme, terrifying power goes missing. With his mother kidnapped and the errant super weapon threatening to cause a catastrophic clash of the gods, Percy sets off to recover the artefact. As he does so, he discovers the many creatures and monsters of legend are also alive today, and are as fierce as ever.

		<desc lang="en">After Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin, this was the Farrelly brothers' breakthrough movie, an all-round, laugh-out-loud comedy of bad taste, leavened by stand-out performances from a top-notch cast. Ben Stiller plays high school geek Ted, invited to the prom by the gorgeous Mary. He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private eye Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>

The mutants are gathered into two camps. Those at Professor Charles Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) school are taught to curb their powers and use them for good, while his opposite number, Magneto (Ian McKellen), believes that humans want to destroy them and is assembling a force to win the day by turning the world's leaders into mutants. The film concentrates on Wolverine and Rogue (Hugh Jackman, Anna Paquin), who side with Xavier as the two factions launch into climactic battle. Edited for language and violence ; HD Wide(n)</desc>
