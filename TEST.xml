Jane Adler is the proprietor of a thriving bakery in a moneyed town in southern California. Jake is her former husband - a successful lawyer and the father to her three children - who's now remarried to the much younger, exceedingly svelte Agness. Complications start to arise when Jane and Jake attend their youngest son's graduation ceremony; they have dinner together afterward, which leads ultimately to the bedroom. He's something of an expert in the field of infidelity but she also finds the old spark still there and, to her surprise, wants more. The complexity in Jane's life deepens when charming architect Adam Schaffer appears on the scene. What's a woman to do? Pursue the excitement she's found with Jake, or opt for potential comfort with divorc√© Adam? And will their lack of discretion lead to Jane and Jake being caught out in the meantime?(n)</desc>

Things go badly wrong for Richard the Lionheart and his men during their return from crusade in the Holy Land.

Back on home soil, Robin makes his way to the Loxley estate in order to hand back the dead man's sword. But he's not only greeted with gratitude, he's also unexpectedly invited to continue living his double life, including cohabiting with Loxley's widow, the strong, independent Marion. It may look as though he's landed on his feet, but there's a dark cloud on the horizon in the form of the slippery, villainous Sir Godfrey - who is simultaneously out to squeeze more taxes from the population to fund the playboy lifestyle of Prince John, while also treacherously laying the ground for a second French invasion of Britain(n)</desc>

Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar. And, of course, blowing up as many objects as possible along the way. Also featuring Jessica Biel as Face's former flame and Patrick Wilson as the team's CIA handler(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Date Night (2010)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Tina Fey and Steve Carell star in Shawn Levy's chase comedy. Phil and Claire Foster feel their marriage has gone a tad stale and decide to pep it up by going out on a date, just like they used to do, before the kids and the mortgage and rest of life's inevitable distractions got in the way. In principal it's a good idea, but their first mistake is to attempt entry into one of Manhattan's swankiest restaurants without a reservation. Their second is far more serious: they bluff their way in, pretending to be a couple who have failed to show up for their table. Unfortunately for the Fosters, the absent diners have serious gangland connections. Even more unfortunately, the people whose identities they've adopted are due to be silenced forever by Mob hitmen. Cue a tightly plotted, gag-packed, headlong flight for survival, which has distinct echoes of the classics of the 40s screwball genre. And keep an eye out for memorable cameos from Mark Wahlberg and James Franco(n)</desc>
