Following a disastrous incident involving a Velcro jump suit at Milan Fashion Week, Brüno is fired from his TV show Funkyzeit mit Brüno, turns his back on the fashion, and heads off to America, hoping to become more famous than Hitler (though for different reasons, naturally). Once Stateside, his in-your-face uber-campness and total lack of self-awareness proceeds to shock, horrify and infuriate everyone he encounters - from a black TV audience, to whom he reveals his adopted African baby, via various homophobic bigots, to a memorable meeting with a Texan Congressman (who's probably still having nightmares about it). And, not willing to stop there, Brüno decides to jet off to the Middle East to solve the Arab/ Israeli conflict - to the utter horror of both parties, and risking injury or worse himself. Opinions are divided over whether Brüno is out to expose the idiocy of homophobia, or whether he's simply using it for laughs. However, there is consensus that this is a very, very funny film, albeit one not for the faint-hearted(n)</desc>

But she seems to thrive on his treatment and a reciprocal relationship begins until Spader, finding she enjoys the humiliation, fires her. Bereft, and with her boyfriend Jeremy Davies unable to fulfil her desires, she plans to win back Spader's affections. Steven Shainberg's film could have been crudely exploitative but thanks to the delicacy of his treatment, the subtlety of the two central performances, plus a leavening of humour, this is a story of unconventional love but love for all that(n)</desc>

Once there, he encounters an old army buddy who has gotten too deep in the CIA's good graces for Dutch's comfort. When he and his team go into the jungle to rescue the others, they get involved in a pitched battle with local guerillas, but they are more than capable of besting these vicious fighters. However, not long after that, they encounter signs that the equally capable men they were sent to rescue were all killed unawares and in an unusually gruesome fashion. Given their training, it should have been impossible for anyone to best all of these commando warriors. Soon, the men from Dutch's own team get picked off one by one, as they grow aware that they are up against something uncanny, not of this world, something that is hunting them for sport. Why? Because their skills make them worthy opponents for the perfectly camouflaged Predator(n)</desc>

Derek Thompson is an ice hockey pro whose main tactical use is the flattening of opponents - often depriving them of a tooth or two in the process. His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist in reality, he's in for a bit of a shock. Unknown to him they do - and they take great umbrage at his slight. Thompson is whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's tried for his misdemeanour and sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. Thus he sprouts wings, is furnished with an outfit completely at odds with his usual image and is given Tracy as a (none too willing) mentor. And, as the comedic misunderstandings and slapstick errors steadily mount, it's clear Thompson wasn't cut out for his new line of work(n)</desc>

He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private eye Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>
