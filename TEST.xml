		<desc lang="en">Director Joe Carnahan's big-screen take, co-produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, on the 80s TV series, which was an OTT action-fest that, at the same time, gloried in and poked fun at its tough-guy stars and their adventures. This time around, a little brasher and more serious than their first incarnation, the team of soldiers comprises the cigar-chomping Col 'Hannibal' Smith, the wilfully eccentric Murdock, toned babe-magnet Face and, of course, BA Baracus, who famously 'pities the fool', usually with more forceful fisticuffing than is strictly necessary. Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar. And, of course, blowing up as many objects as possible along the way. Also featuring Jessica Biel as Face's former flame and Patrick Wilson as the team's CIA handler(n)</desc>

Icarus II (Icarus I, the previous attempt, went missing years after launch) is captained by Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada), with Capa (Cillian Murphy), a physicist, and Corazon (Michelle Yeoh) in charge of the ship's environment. But as Icarus II approaches Mercury, it begins to receive signals from Icarus I, and when they board the supposedly lost craft, they encounter an entity that endangers the whole mission.

In principal it's a good idea, but their first mistake is to attempt entry into one of Manhattan's swankiest restaurants without a reservation. Their second is far more serious: they bluff their way in, pretending to be a couple who have failed to show up for their table. Unfortunately for the Fosters, the absent diners have serious gangland connections. Even more unfortunately, the people whose identities they've adopted are due to be silenced forever by Mob hitmen. Cue a tightly plotted, gag-packed, headlong flight for survival, which has distinct echoes of the classics of the 40s screwball genre.

		<title lang="en">Predator (1987)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Dutch has a code of honor which he will not violate, even when his life depends on it. Paradoxically, his code of honor gives him the backbone to survive as a military special forces operative when he is sent on a covert mission to rescue another group which was sent in to assist some nefarious U.S. government plan in a Latin American country. Once there, he encounters an old army buddy who has gotten too deep in the CIA's good graces for Dutch's comfort. When he and his team go into the jungle to rescue the others, they get involved in a pitched battle with local guerillas, but they are more than capable of besting these vicious fighters. However, not long after that, they encounter signs that the equally capable men they were sent to rescue were all killed unawares and in an unusually gruesome fashion. Given their training, it should have been impossible for anyone to best all of these commando warriors. Soon, the men from Dutch's own team get picked off one by one, as they grow aware that they are up against something uncanny, not of this world, something that is hunting them for sport. Why? Because their skills make them worthy opponents for the perfectly camouflaged Predator(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Julia Roberts, Armie Hammer and Lily Collins star in Tarsem Singh's reworking of the Snow White fairy tale. When her father the King goes missing on a quest to save his kingdom, the 18-year-old Snow White is left alone with her stepmother the Queen, who has raised the girl since her natural mother died giving birth to her. This devotion should not be mistaken for love, for the Queen is utterly self-absorbed and evil. And when both women are equally attracted to the visiting Prince Alcott, the monarch decides to kill her rival. But Brighton, the henchman told to dispatch the princess, can't bring himself to fulfil his task and lets her go. And thus, deep in the forest, Snow White discovers a band of brigand dwarves who are only too happy to help her win the hand of her prince and depose her murderous stepmother. There are some violent scenes (hence the PG rating), but the general tone is humorous, and the acting at times plays second fiddle to the astonishing set and costume design (Eiko Ishioka was posthumously Oscar-nominated for the Best Achievement in Costume Design)(n)</desc>
