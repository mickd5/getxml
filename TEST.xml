		<title lang="en">The Abyss</title>
		<desc lang="en">Approved by director James Cameron, The Abyss - Special Edition is an extended director's cut of the 1989 underwater science fiction epic, reinstating nearly a half hour of footage removed from the original release under studio pressureThe plot remains the same: the crew of an experimental, high-tech submersible is called into action to investigate a mysterious nuclear submarine crashA series of strange encounters leads the crew to suspect the accident was caused by an extraterrestrial craft, and that they may be participating in an encounter with an alien speciesHowever, in order to make contact, they must not only brave the abyss, an exceedingly deep underwater canyon, but also deal with the violent actions of one of their own crew members, an increasingly paranoid Navy SEAL officerMuch of the restored footage places these events in a grander political context, as the crew's mission becomes a factor in the dangerous escalation of nuclear tension between the U.Sand the Soviet UnionThe largest change involves the film's ending, which provides further information on the aliens' mission on Earth, bringing the film to closer to Cameron's intention: a modern remake of Robert Wise's The Day the Earth Stood Still.(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">The Abyss</title>
		<desc lang="en">Approved by director James Cameron, The Abyss - Special Edition is an extended director's cut of the 1989 underwater science fiction epic, reinstating nearly a half hour of footage removed from the original release under studio pressureThe plot remains the same: the crew of an experimental, high-tech submersible is called into action to investigate a mysterious nuclear submarine crashA series of strange encounters leads the crew to suspect the accident was caused by an extraterrestrial craft, and that they may be participating in an encounter with an alien speciesHowever, in order to make contact, they must not only brave the abyss, an exceedingly deep underwater canyon, but also deal with the violent actions of one of their own crew members, an increasingly paranoid Navy SEAL officerMuch of the restored footage places these events in a grander political context, as the crew's mission becomes a factor in the dangerous escalation of nuclear tension between the U.Sand the Soviet UnionThe largest change involves the film's ending, which provides further information on the aliens' mission on Earth, bringing the film to closer to Cameron's intention: a modern remake of Robert Wise's The Day the Earth Stood Still.(n)</desc>

Graham), and the intensity of the experience has landed him in a mental institution. To end his torment and achieve a level of closure, Tommy escapes from the hospital and heads to the graveyard where Jason is buried, intending to dig up the body and cremate it.

Superstitious locals warn against it, but the fresh-faced young people -- Jack (Kevin Bacon), Alice (Adrienne King), Bill (Harry Crosby), Marcie (Jeannine Taylor) and Ned (Mark Nelson) -- pay little heed to the old-timers. Then they find themselves stalked by a brutal killer. As they're slashed, shot and stabbed, the counselors struggle to stay alive against a merciless opponent.(n)</desc>

Inevitably, Paul relates the story of Jason Voorhees (Warrington Gillette), a boy who ostensibly drowned at the camp and whose mother murdered a group of counselors in revenge. No one takes the tale seriously until a very much alive Jason begins gruesomely eliminating people.(n)</desc>
