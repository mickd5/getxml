Complications start to arise when Jane and Jake attend their youngest son's graduation ceremony; they have dinner together afterward, which leads ultimately to the bedroom.

Things go badly wrong for Richard the Lionheart and his men during their return from crusade in the Holy Land. One of the King's soldiers who escapes with his life is archer Robin Longstride, who adopts the persona of the recently slain Robin of Loxley in order to get back to the safety of England. Back on home soil, Robin makes his way to the Loxley estate in order to hand back the dead man's sword. But he's not only greeted with gratitude, he's also unexpectedly invited to continue living his double life, including cohabiting with Loxley's widow, the strong, independent Marion. It may look as though he's landed on his feet, but there's a dark cloud on the horizon in the form of the slippery, villainous Sir Godfrey - who is simultaneously out to squeeze more taxes from the population to fund the playboy lifestyle of Prince John, while also treacherously laying the ground for a second French invasion of Britain(n)</desc>

Things go badly wrong for Richard the Lionheart and his men during their return from crusade in the Holy Land. One of the King's soldiers who escapes with his life is archer Robin Longstride, who adopts the persona of the recently slain Robin of Loxley in order to get back to the safety of England. Back on home soil, Robin makes his way to the Loxley estate in order to hand back the dead man's sword. But he's not only greeted with gratitude, he's also unexpectedly invited to continue living his double life, including cohabiting with Loxley's widow, the strong, independent Marion. It may look as though he's landed on his feet, but there's a dark cloud on the horizon in the form of the slippery, villainous Sir Godfrey - who is simultaneously out to squeeze more taxes from the population to fund the playboy lifestyle of Prince John, while also treacherously laying the ground for a second French invasion of Britain(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Date Night (2010)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Tina Fey and Steve Carell star in Shawn Levy's chase comedy. Phil and Claire Foster feel their marriage has gone a tad stale and decide to pep it up by going out on a date, just like they used to do, before the kids and the mortgage and rest of life's inevitable distractions got in the way. In principal it's a good idea, but their first mistake is to attempt entry into one of Manhattan's swankiest restaurants without a reservation. Their second is far more serious: they bluff their way in, pretending to be a couple who have failed to show up for their table. Unfortunately for the Fosters, the absent diners have serious gangland connections. Even more unfortunately, the people whose identities they've adopted are due to be silenced forever by Mob hitmen. Cue a tightly plotted, gag-packed, headlong flight for survival, which has distinct echoes of the classics of the 40s screwball genre. And keep an eye out for memorable cameos from Mark Wahlberg and James Franco(n)</desc>
