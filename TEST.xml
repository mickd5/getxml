		<title lang="en">Predator (1987)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Dutch has a code of honor which he will not violate, even when his life depends on it. Paradoxically, his code of honor gives him the backbone to survive as a military special forces operative when he is sent on a covert mission to rescue another group which was sent in to assist some nefarious U.S. government plan in a Latin American country. Once there, he encounters an old army buddy who has gotten too deep in the CIA's good graces for Dutch's comfort. When he and his team go into the jungle to rescue the others, they get involved in a pitched battle with local guerillas, but they are more than capable of besting these vicious fighters. However, not long after that, they encounter signs that the equally capable men they were sent to rescue were all killed unawares and in an unusually gruesome fashion. Given their training, it should have been impossible for anyone to best all of these commando warriors. Soon, the men from Dutch's own team get picked off one by one, as they grow aware that they are up against something uncanny, not of this world, something that is hunting them for sport. Why? Because their skills make them worthy opponents for the perfectly camouflaged Predator(n)</desc>

Complications start to arise when Jane and Jake attend their youngest son's graduation ceremony; they have dinner together afterward, which leads ultimately to the bedroom. He's something of an expert in the field of infidelity but she also finds the old spark still there and, to her surprise, wants more. The complexity in Jane's life deepens when charming architect Adam Schaffer appears on the scene. What's a woman to do? Pursue the excitement she's found with Jake, or opt for potential comfort with divorcé Adam? And will their lack of discretion lead to Jane and Jake being caught out in the meantime?(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Dirty Dancing (1987)</title>
		<desc lang="en">The late Hollywood heartthrob Patrick Swayze and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Grey team up as dirty dance partners in this Oscar winning romantic classic. A teenage girl learns about love, adult responsibility, and how to do The Dirty Boogie. A teenage girl learns about love, adult responsibility, and how to do The Dirty Boogie in this romantic drama. In 1963, "Baby" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) is a 17-year-old spending the summer with her family at a resort hotel in the Catskills; she plans on being in the Peace Corps next summer, so this is expected to be her last summer as a carefree adolescent. Baby doesn't get along with her older sister, Lisa (Jane Brucker), and she's bored to tears by most of the older guests at the resort. However, one night Baby hears what sounds like a party going on in the employee's dormitory, and she pokes her head in to discover most of the hotel staff enjoying the sort of close dancing that would get you kicked out of the senior prom in no time flat. Baby is particularly struck by handsome Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), a dancer in the resort's floor show, and falls head over heels in love, wanting to be near him. Dirty Dancing was a surprise box-office hit, and the soundtrack album was an even bigger success, spawning several hit singles. Starring Patrick Swayze, Jennifer Grey &amp; Jane Brucker(n)</desc>
