Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong.

His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist in reality, he's in for a bit of a shock. Unknown to him they do - and they take great umbrage at his slight. Thompson is whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's tried for his misdemeanour and sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. Thus he sprouts wings, is furnished with an outfit completely at odds with his usual image and is given Tracy as a (none too willing) mentor.

The wounded Klaatu asks for access to the United Nations to deliver his message, but the Secretary of Defence, Regina Jackson, instead orders that he should be taken away for further investigations.
