Pursue the excitement she's found with Jake, or opt for potential comfort with divorcé Adam? And will their lack of discretion lead to Jane and Jake being caught out in the meantime?(n)</desc>

Once there, he encounters an old army buddy who has gotten too deep in the CIA's good graces for Dutch's comfort. When he and his team go into the jungle to rescue the others, they get involved in a pitched battle with local guerillas, but they are more than capable of besting these vicious fighters. However, not long after that, they encounter signs that the equally capable men they were sent to rescue were all killed unawares and in an unusually gruesome fashion. Given their training, it should have been impossible for anyone to best all of these commando warriors. Soon, the men from Dutch's own team get picked off one by one, as they grow aware that they are up against something uncanny, not of this world, something that is hunting them for sport. Why? Because their skills make them worthy opponents for the perfectly camouflaged Predator(n)</desc>

Phil and Claire Foster feel their marriage has gone a tad stale and decide to pep it up by going out on a date, just like they used to do, before the kids and the mortgage and rest of life's inevitable distractions got in the way. In principal it's a good idea, but their first mistake is to attempt entry into one of Manhattan's swankiest restaurants without a reservation. Their second is far more serious: they bluff their way in, pretending to be a couple who have failed to show up for their table. Unfortunately for the Fosters, the absent diners have serious gangland connections. Even more unfortunately, the people whose identities they've adopted are due to be silenced forever by Mob hitmen. Cue a tightly plotted, gag-packed, headlong flight for survival, which has distinct echoes of the classics of the 40s screwball genre. And keep an eye out for memorable cameos from Mark Wahlberg and James Franco(n)</desc>

It turns out that while his mum Sally (Catherine Keener) is human, his father (Kevin McKidd) is the Greek god of the sea and earthquakes, Poseidon; which makes our hero a demigod. At first it's all a bit much to take in, as he learns the modern world is teeming with deities and their offspring. And things take a turn for the worse when Zeus (Sean Bean) suspects Percy of theft after the lightning bolt that confers supreme, terrifying power goes missing. With his mother kidnapped and the errant super weapon threatening to cause a catastrophic clash of the gods, Percy sets off to recover the artefact. As he does so, he discovers the many creatures and monsters of legend are also alive today, and are as fierce as ever. Also starring Pierce Brosnan (as a centaur), Uma Thurman (as Medusa) and Steve Coogan (as Hades)(n)</desc>

His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist in reality, he's in for a bit of a shock. Unknown to him they do - and they take great umbrage at his slight. Thompson is whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's tried for his misdemeanour and sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. Thus he sprouts wings, is furnished with an outfit completely at odds with his usual image and is given Tracy as a (none too willing) mentor.

		<title lang="en">Tooth Fairy (2010)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Dwayne Johnson stars in Michael Lembeck's family fantasy comedy about a tough-guy sportsman who learns the hard way not to puncture a child's illusions. Derek Thompson is an ice hockey pro whose main tactical use is the flattening of opponents - often depriving them of a tooth or two in the process. His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist in reality, he's in for a bit of a shock. Unknown to him they do - and they take great umbrage at his slight. Thompson is whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's tried for his misdemeanour and sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. Thus he sprouts wings, is furnished with an outfit completely at odds with his usual image and is given Tracy as a (none too willing) mentor. And, as the comedic misunderstandings and slapstick errors steadily mount, it's clear Thompson wasn't cut out for his new line of work(n)</desc>

Ben Stiller plays high school geek Ted, invited to the prom by the gorgeous Mary. He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private eye Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>

Bob Wallace (Crosby) and Phil Davis (Kaye) are friends who met while serving in World War II and have subsequently become a very successful song-and-dance team. They meet singing sisters Betty (Clooney) and Judy (Vera-Ellen) at a nightclub in Florida and, with a hint of romance in the air, together head off to rural Vermont, where the girls are booked to appear at a ski lodge. When they arrive, they discover that the place is run by the men's former commanding officer, Major General Waverly (Dean Jagger), who's in dire financial straits because unseasonably warm weather is keeping the snow at bay. So the four entertainers make plans to bail him out by staging a spectacular musical benefit show... Shot in Technicolor, the film was the first to be released in the high-resolution widescreen VistaVision format and, with its songs written by Irving Berlin, the movie was the year's top box-office hit(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Mr. Popper's Penguins (2011)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Jim Carrey stars in director Mark Waters' family comedy, loosely based on a classic children's book. Tom Popper is a New York property shark with a failed marriage and a strained relationship with his kids. Popper's own father was an explorer, usually absent while Tom was growing up. That could be reason for Tom's emotional disengagement, but his father certainly is the reason Tom ends up receiving a crate of six gentoo penguins - a bequest from the old man's deathbed. Manhattan isn't the obvious place in which to care for the birds, but not only does Popper quickly bond with his charges, his adventures with them also act as a springboard for possible reconciliation with his family - as well as ample opportunity for Carrey to ply his trademarked rubber-faced, flexed-limbed comedic turn. The penguins are real ones, their antics only enhanced rather than generated by CGI. And the only dark cloud on his horizon is the zoo's Nat Jones, who believes the creatures would be better off with him than in Popper's apartment.

		<title lang="en">Ted (2012)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis star in Seth MacFarlane's irreverent and vulgar comedy-drama about the relationship between a man, a woman and the man's toy bear. The young John Bennett had such an unpleasant and lonely childhood that he wished his soft toy, Teddy, would come alive and be his friend. And to everyone's surprise it did. The walking, talking and wisecracking plush creature became an overnight sensation - even appearing on The Johnny Carson Show. But fame being what it is, Teddy's time in the limelight ended. Now, Bennett is a directionless slacker in his 30s and still inseparable from Ted. They share a fondness for booze and pot, but the cynical bear has also developed his own distinctive sexual peccadillos, which he indulges with prostitutes (while harbouring a deep resentment that he wasn't made with anatomical correctness). However, Bennett's emotional loyalty towards Ted faces its biggest test yet, in the shape of Bennett's girlfriend Lori. She feels Bennett needs to grow up - and choose between her and Ted. Meanwhile, the bear must deal with a fan who's stalking him(n)</desc>
