He's something of an expert in the field of infidelity but she also finds the old spark still there and, to her surprise, wants more. The complexity in Jane's life deepens when charming architect Adam Schaffer appears on the scene. What's a woman to do?

		<title lang="en">Date Night (2010)</title>

Phil and Claire Foster feel their marriage has gone a tad stale and decide to pep it up by going out on a date, just like they used to do, before the kids and the mortgage and rest of life's inevitable distractions got in the way. In principal it's a good idea, but their first mistake is to attempt entry into one of Manhattan's swankiest restaurants without a reservation. Their second is far more serious: they bluff their way in, pretending to be a couple who have failed to show up for their table. Unfortunately for the Fosters, the absent diners have serious gangland connections. Even more unfortunately, the people whose identities they've adopted are due to be silenced forever by Mob hitmen. Cue a tightly plotted, gag-packed, headlong flight for survival, which has distinct echoes of the classics of the 40s screwball genre. And keep an eye out for memorable cameos from Mark Wahlberg and James Franco(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Mr. Popper's Penguins (2011)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Jim Carrey stars in director Mark Waters' family comedy, loosely based on a classic children's book. Tom Popper is a New York property shark with a failed marriage and a strained relationship with his kids. Popper's own father was an explorer, usually absent while Tom was growing up. That could be reason for Tom's emotional disengagement, but his father certainly is the reason Tom ends up receiving a crate of six gentoo penguins - a bequest from the old man's deathbed. Manhattan isn't the obvious place in which to care for the birds, but not only does Popper quickly bond with his charges, his adventures with them also act as a springboard for possible reconciliation with his family - as well as ample opportunity for Carrey to ply his trademarked rubber-faced, flexed-limbed comedic turn. The penguins are real ones, their antics only enhanced rather than generated by CGI. And the only dark cloud on his horizon is the zoo's Nat Jones, who believes the creatures would be better off with him than in Popper's apartment. Also starring Ophelia Lovibond as Popper's assistant Pippi(n)</desc>

In this third instalment of CS Lewis's enduring saga, Lucy and Edmund are transported back to the mystical land of Narnia while admiring what turns out to be an enchanted painting. Unfortunately for them, their self-centred, immensely irritating younger cousin Eustace was with them at the time, so he's along for the ride too. In Narnia, they meet King Caspian, who explains that a new malaise has crept across his kingdom, turning people's unpleasant imaginings into reality. This pandemic can only be reversed by rescuing banished allies and travelling to the Dark Isle to stem the evil at its source. So, it's all aboard Caspian's ship The Dawn Treader and off on a thrilling, scary expedition featuring dragons, ghosts, sea monsters and malevolent magic. Also starring Simon Pegg, Anna Popplewell, William Moseley, Liam Neeson and Tilda Swinton(n)</desc>

Created by Collins Avenue Productions, it is set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at the Abby Lee Dance Company, and follows children's early careers in dance show business, and their mothers. A spinoff series, Dance Moms: Miami, set in Miami at Victor Smalley and Angel Armas' dance studio, Stars Dance Studio, premiered on April 3, 2012, and was cancelled in September 2012 after eight episodes.On October 10, 2012, Lifetime announced that they had picked up Dance Moms for a third season, consisting of 26 episodes, which debuted on January 1, 2013.Set in Pittsburgh, Dance Moms follows the Abby Lee Dance Company's Elite Competition Dance Group of young girls aged 7 to 15 years as they travel week-to-week to various competitions in hopes of a national title. Much of the program is focused on the mothers of the dancers as they both encourage their daughter's careers as dancers and rival the other dancers' mothers. Later in the program, Candy Apple's Dance Studio was introduced as a rival dance company.Every week on the show, Abby uses a pyramid scheme to show the moms and the dancers who she feels did the best in her eyes, and who needs to improve. Miller had never used a pyramid In her studio prior to Dance Moms, and when asked about the pyramid Miller stated in an interview, "I've never done that in my life. That has nothing to do with me. That's the show; they came up with that whole process." The pyramid changes every week, and it has been reflected that the moms' behavior often affects the girls' placement on the pyramid(n)</desc>
