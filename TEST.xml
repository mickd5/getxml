Paradoxically, his code of honor gives him the backbone to survive as a military special forces operative when he is sent on a covert mission to rescue another group which was sent in to assist some nefarious U.S. government plan in a Latin American country. Once there, he encounters an old army buddy who has gotten too deep in the CIA's good graces for Dutch's comfort. When he and his team go into the jungle to rescue the others, they get involved in a pitched battle with local guerillas, but they are more than capable of besting these vicious fighters. However, not long after that, they encounter signs that the equally capable men they were sent to rescue were all killed unawares and in an unusually gruesome fashion. Given their training, it should have been impossible for anyone to best all of these commando warriors. Soon, the men from Dutch's own team get picked off one by one, as they grow aware that they are up against something uncanny, not of this world, something that is hunting them for sport. Why? Because their skills make them worthy opponents for the perfectly camouflaged Predator(n)</desc>

Ben Stiller plays high school geek Ted, invited to the prom by the gorgeous Mary. He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private eye Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">White Christmas (1954)</title>
		<desc lang="en">(1954) Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Rosemary Clooney star in this festive family favourite from prolific director Michael Curtiz. Bob Wallace (Crosby) and Phil Davis (Kaye) are friends who met while serving in World War II and have subsequently become a very successful song-and-dance team. They meet singing sisters Betty (Clooney) and Judy (Vera-Ellen) at a nightclub in Florida and, with a hint of romance in the air, together head off to rural Vermont, where the girls are booked to appear at a ski lodge. When they arrive, they discover that the place is run by the men's former commanding officer, Major General Waverly (Dean Jagger), who's in dire financial straits because unseasonably warm weather is keeping the snow at bay. So the four entertainers make plans to bail him out by staging a spectacular musical benefit show... Shot in Technicolor, the film was the first to be released in the high-resolution widescreen VistaVision format and, with its songs written by Irving Berlin, the movie was the year's top box-office hit(n)</desc>

The traditional Christmas tale will never be the same after this cleverly twisted, merrily irreverent story of a Santa so bad that he's funny. Billy Bob Thornton stars (in a Golden Globe-nominated role) as Willie T. Stokes, a washed-up, wisecracking department store Santa who is only in the business for the criminal opportunities. Every Christmas Eve this Santa and his ingenious Elf' Willie's midget partner-in-crime Marcus (Tony Cox), crack the store safe and make off with their own holiday stash. But this year Santa and his Elf find their annual heist endangered by a pesky store manager (John Ritter), a savvy mall detective (Bernie Mac), a sexy Santa fan (Lauren Graham) and an 8-year-old misfit (Brett Kelly) who decides to believe that Willie: intoxicated, acid-tongued and felonious as he is, is the real Santa(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">A hilariously criminal Santa finds a measure of holiday redemption when he befriends a troubled kid. The traditional Christmas tale will never be the same after this cleverly twisted, merrily irreverent story of a Santa so bad that he's funny. Billy Bob Thornton stars (in a Golden Globe-nominated role) as Willie T. Stokes, a washed-up, wisecracking department store Santa who is only in the business for the criminal opportunities. Every Christmas Eve this Santa and his ingenious Elf' Willie's midget partner-in-crime Marcus (Tony Cox), crack the store safe and make off with their own holiday stash. But this year Santa and his Elf find their annual heist endangered by a pesky store manager (John Ritter), a savvy mall detective (Bernie Mac), a sexy Santa fan (Lauren Graham) and an 8-year-old misfit (Brett Kelly) who decides to believe that Willie: intoxicated, acid-tongued and felonious as he is, is the real Santa(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">The network premiere of Michael Apted's family fantasy adventure, telling the continued adventures of the children who discovered a fantastical world hidden at the back of a wardrobe. In this third instalment of CS Lewis's enduring saga, Lucy and Edmund are transported back to the mystical land of Narnia while admiring what turns out to be an enchanted painting. Unfortunately for them, their self-centred, immensely irritating younger cousin Eustace was with them at the time, so he's along for the ride too. In Narnia, they meet King Caspian, who explains that a new malaise has crept across his kingdom, turning people's unpleasant imaginings into reality. This pandemic can only be reversed by rescuing banished allies and travelling to the Dark Isle to stem the evil at its source. So, it's all aboard Caspian's ship The Dawn Treader and off on a thrilling, scary expedition featuring dragons, ghosts, sea monsters and malevolent magic. Also starring Simon Pegg, Anna Popplewell, William Moseley, Liam Neeson and Tilda Swinton(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Dance Moms</title>
		<desc lang="en">Dance Moms is an American dance reality series that debuted on Lifetime on July 13, 2011. Created by Collins Avenue Productions, it is set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at the Abby Lee Dance Company, and follows children's early careers in dance show business, and their mothers. A spinoff series, Dance Moms: Miami, set in Miami at Victor Smalley and Angel Armas' dance studio, Stars Dance Studio, premiered on April 3, 2012, and was cancelled in September 2012 after eight episodes.On October 10, 2012, Lifetime announced that they had picked up Dance Moms for a third season, consisting of 26 episodes, which debuted on January 1, 2013.Set in Pittsburgh, Dance Moms follows the Abby Lee Dance Company's Elite Competition Dance Group of young girls aged 7 to 15 years as they travel week-to-week to various competitions in hopes of a national title. Much of the program is focused on the mothers of the dancers as they both encourage their daughter's careers as dancers and rival the other dancers' mothers. Later in the program, Candy Apple's Dance Studio was introduced as a rival dance company.Every week on the show, Abby uses a pyramid scheme to show the moms and the dancers who she feels did the best in her eyes, and who needs to improve. Miller had never used a pyramid In her studio prior to Dance Moms, and when asked about the pyramid Miller stated in an interview, "I've never done that in my life. That has nothing to do with me. That's the show; they came up with that whole process." The pyramid changes every week, and it has been reflected that the moms' behavior often affects the girls' placement on the pyramid(n)</desc>

When he wakes up to find that his wish to be "big" (in order to woo class beauty Cynthia Benson) has been mysteriously granted, Josh is confused and frightened at being thrust into an adult world for which he is utterly unprepared. When he gets his first job, with a toy company run by "Mac" Mac Millan (Robert Loggia), he discovers that being "big" as he always suspected, has definite advantages: freedom, money to spend, unlimited toys. But he is not prepared for what happens when he attracts the attention of a co-worker - - chic, ambitious Susan Lawrence, who makes Cynthia Benson look like...well, a little girl.
