		<desc lang="en">Director Joe Carnahan's big-screen take, co-produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, on the 80s TV series, which was an OTT action-fest that, at the same time, gloried in and poked fun at its tough-guy stars and their adventures. This time around, a little brasher and more serious than their first incarnation, the team of soldiers comprises the cigar-chomping Col 'Hannibal' Smith, the wilfully eccentric Murdock, toned babe-magnet Face and, of course, BA Baracus, who famously 'pities the fool', usually with more forceful fisticuffing than is strictly necessary. Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar. And, of course, blowing up as many objects as possible along the way. Also featuring Jessica Biel as Face's former flame and Patrick Wilson as the team's CIA handler(n)</desc>

Following a disastrous incident involving a Velcro jump suit at Milan Fashion Week, Brüno is fired from his TV show Funkyzeit mit Brüno, turns his back on the fashion, and heads off to America, hoping to become more famous than Hitler (though for different reasons, naturally). Once Stateside, his in-your-face uber-campness and total lack of self-awareness proceeds to shock, horrify and infuriate everyone he encounters - from a black TV audience, to whom he reveals his adopted African baby, via various homophobic bigots, to a memorable meeting with a Texan Congressman (who's probably still having nightmares about it). And, not willing to stop there, Brüno decides to jet off to the Middle East to solve the Arab/ Israeli conflict - to the utter horror of both parties, and risking injury or worse himself. Opinions are divided over whether Brüno is out to expose the idiocy of homophobia, or whether he's simply using it for laughs. However, there is consensus that this is a very, very funny film, albeit one not for the faint-hearted(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">The A-Team (2010)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Director Joe Carnahan's big-screen take, co-produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, on the 80s TV series, which was an OTT action-fest that, at the same time, gloried in and poked fun at its tough-guy stars and their adventures. This time around, a little brasher and more serious than their first incarnation, the team of soldiers comprises the cigar-chomping Col 'Hannibal' Smith, the wilfully eccentric Murdock, toned babe-magnet Face and, of course, BA Baracus, who famously 'pities the fool', usually with more forceful fisticuffing than is strictly necessary. Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar. And, of course, blowing up as many objects as possible along the way. Also featuring Jessica Biel as Face's former flame and Patrick Wilson as the team's CIA handler(n)</desc>

His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist in reality, he's in for a bit of a shock. Unknown to him they do - and they take great umbrage at his slight. Thompson is whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's tried for his misdemeanour and sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. Thus he sprouts wings, is furnished with an outfit completely at odds with his usual image and is given Tracy as a (none too willing) mentor.

		<desc lang="en">No importan las fronteras, la cultura ni el tiempo, la comida es una de las cosas que la gente tiene en común. Desde las cavernas hasta la era espacial nos gusta la comida para llevar. Mientras que las hamburguesas y las papas fritas son los reyes de la comida rápida, la comida para llevar ha llegado a niveles de sofisticación mas allá del auto servicio. El charqui permitió a los exploradores conocer nuevas fronteras y las barras proteicas de ahora, llevan al límite nuestros cuerpos. Desde la comida en campos de batalla hasta las fronteras lejanos del espacio, la comida siempre ha estado a mano para llevar. Te invitamos a esta cuenta regresiva de la comida rápida que nos pasea por pasado, nos impulsa al futuro, y a veces, (no nos olvidemos de las famosas galletas de la fortuna), revelan nuestro destino(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Toda idea comienza con una chispa, pero algunas crecen y logran cambiar al mundo. La necesidad es la madre de la invención. Desde la oscuridad el hombre busca la luz y comienza usando una simple vela; de un lugar alguien quiere comunicarse a la distancia y nace la idea del teléfono. Pero algunos inventos transformaron la vida más allá de nuestros hogares: la máquina a vapor, el telescopio, y el internet todo cambia nuestra vida. En esta cuenta regresiva veremos como la inventiva llega de todas formas y maneras. Algunos nacieron con un sencillo uso, como el martillo, mientras que otros desafiaron los límites que no creían posibles, como el avión. Pero sin importar el porcentaje de inspiración o transpiración por cada invento, nos han cambiado la vida para siempre(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Nuestra vida está tan llena de cosas hoy en día, que es muy facil de restarles importancia. Pero cuando el destino y la historia se combinan, hasta el objeto más sencillo, se infunde de relevancia histórica. Un trocito de roca es solamente eso hasta que nos dicen que es de la Luna, y entonces, se convierte en un salto para la humanidad. Una guitarra es solamente una guitarra pero si nos dicen que es tocando una guitarra que pertenecía a Jimmy Hendrix, entonces estas tocando una generación, no a una caja de madera con cuerdas . Algunos objetos son únicos en su especie (la máscara mortuória del Rey Tutankhamen) y otros son universales (un anillo de bodas), y todos nos afectan muy personalmente a cada quien. Son símbolos y sin ellos, definitivamente el mundo no sería el mismo(n)</desc>
