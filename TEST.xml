The sun is dying, Earth suffers a perpetual winter and humanity's only hope is a spaceship that will deliver an atomic device into the heart of the Sun to 'kickstart' it again. Icarus II (Icarus I, the previous attempt, went missing years after launch) is captained by Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada), with Capa (Cillian Murphy), a physicist, and Corazon (Michelle Yeoh) in charge of the ship's environment. But as Icarus II approaches Mercury, it begins to receive signals from Icarus I, and when they board the supposedly lost craft, they encounter an entity that endangers the whole mission. Sunshine is written by Alex Garland, who also collaborated with Boyle on 28 Days Later. M,W,R,S,(n)</desc>

Paradoxically, his code of honor gives him the backbone to survive as a military special forces operative when he is sent on a covert mission to rescue another group which was sent in to assist some nefarious U.S. government plan in a Latin American country. Once there, he encounters an old army buddy who has gotten too deep in the CIA's good graces for Dutch's comfort. When he and his team go into the jungle to rescue the others, they get involved in a pitched battle with local guerillas, but they are more than capable of besting these vicious fighters. However, not long after that, they encounter signs that the equally capable men they were sent to rescue were all killed unawares and in an unusually gruesome fashion. Given their training, it should have been impossible for anyone to best all of these commando warriors. Soon, the men from Dutch's own team get picked off one by one, as they grow aware that they are up against something uncanny, not of this world, something that is hunting them for sport. Why? Because their skills make them worthy opponents for the perfectly camouflaged Predator(n)</desc>

It turns out that while his mum Sally (Catherine Keener) is human, his father (Kevin McKidd) is the Greek god of the sea and earthquakes, Poseidon; which makes our hero a demigod. At first it's all a bit much to take in, as he learns the modern world is teeming with deities and their offspring. And things take a turn for the worse when Zeus (Sean Bean) suspects Percy of theft after the lightning bolt that confers supreme, terrifying power goes missing. With his mother kidnapped and the errant super weapon threatening to cause a catastrophic clash of the gods, Percy sets off to recover the artefact. As he does so, he discovers the many creatures and monsters of legend are also alive today, and are as fierce as ever. Also starring Pierce Brosnan (as a centaur), Uma Thurman (as Medusa) and Steve Coogan (as Hades)(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">There's Something About Mary (1998)</title>
		<desc lang="en">After Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin, this was the Farrelly brothers' breakthrough movie, an all-round, laugh-out-loud comedy of bad taste, leavened by stand-out performances from a top-notch cast. Ben Stiller plays high school geek Ted, invited to the prom by the gorgeous Mary. He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private eye Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Dance Moms</title>
		<desc lang="en">Dance Moms is an American dance reality series that debuted on Lifetime on July 13, 2011. Created by Collins Avenue Productions, it is set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at the Abby Lee Dance Company, and follows children's early careers in dance show business, and their mothers. A spinoff series, Dance Moms: Miami, set in Miami at Victor Smalley and Angel Armas' dance studio, Stars Dance Studio, premiered on April 3, 2012, and was cancelled in September 2012 after eight episodes.On October 10, 2012, Lifetime announced that they had picked up Dance Moms for a third season, consisting of 26 episodes, which debuted on January 1, 2013.Set in Pittsburgh, Dance Moms follows the Abby Lee Dance Company's Elite Competition Dance Group of young girls aged 7 to 15 years as they travel week-to-week to various competitions in hopes of a national title. Much of the program is focused on the mothers of the dancers as they both encourage their daughter's careers as dancers and rival the other dancers' mothers. Later in the program, Candy Apple's Dance Studio was introduced as a rival dance company.Every week on the show, Abby uses a pyramid scheme to show the moms and the dancers who she feels did the best in her eyes, and who needs to improve. Miller had never used a pyramid In her studio prior to Dance Moms, and when asked about the pyramid Miller stated in an interview, "I've never done that in my life. That has nothing to do with me. That's the show; they came up with that whole process." The pyramid changes every week, and it has been reflected that the moms' behavior often affects the girls' placement on the pyramid(n)</desc>
