		<title lang="en">The Abyss</title>
		<desc lang="en">Approved by director James Cameron, The Abyss - Special Edition is an extended director's cut of the 1989 underwater science fiction epic, reinstating nearly a half hour of footage removed from the original release under studio pressureThe plot remains the same: the crew of an experimental, high-tech submersible is called into action to investigate a mysterious nuclear submarine crashA series of strange encounters leads the crew to suspect the accident was caused by an extraterrestrial craft, and that they may be participating in an encounter with an alien speciesHowever, in order to make contact, they must not only brave the abyss, an exceedingly deep underwater canyon, but also deal with the violent actions of one of their own crew members, an increasingly paranoid Navy SEAL officerMuch of the restored footage places these events in a grander political context, as the crew's mission becomes a factor in the dangerous escalation of nuclear tension between the U.Sand the Soviet UnionThe largest change involves the film's ending, which provides further information on the aliens' mission on Earth, bringing the film to closer to Cameron's intention: a modern remake of Robert Wise's The Day the Earth Stood Still.(n)</desc>

Not only is Buzz a superhero with neato gadgets that amaze the others; he is also a really nice toy, eager to help the othersEveryone likes him, except for poor usurped Woody, who hates playing second fiddleIf Buzz has one Achilles heel, it is that he doesn't realize that he is a toyAlthough Woody initially tries to accept Buzz, his resentment begins to build up until, desperate to regain his favored position with Andy, Woody "accidentally" pushes Buzz out of the windowIn the toys' world there is no place more fearful than the outdoorsSure enough nasty neighbor Sid has a penchant for blowing up toys with firecrackers and using the shattered parts to make monstrous creations that might even scare director Tim BurtonSoon after the incident, basically good-hearted Woody begins feeling guilty and decides he must save Buzz from certain destructionHe and the other toys set out to find him and end up on a riotous, exciting chase to save their friend.(n)</desc>
