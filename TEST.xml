Icarus II (Icarus I, the previous attempt, went missing years after launch) is captained by Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada), with Capa (Cillian Murphy), a physicist, and Corazon (Michelle Yeoh) in charge of the ship's environment. But as Icarus II approaches Mercury, it begins to receive signals from Icarus I, and when they board the supposedly lost craft, they encounter an entity that endangers the whole mission. Sunshine is written by Alex Garland, who also collaborated with Boyle on 28 Days Later. M,W,R,S,(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Date Night (2010)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Tina Fey and Steve Carell star in Shawn Levy's chase comedy. Phil and Claire Foster feel their marriage has gone a tad stale and decide to pep it up by going out on a date, just like they used to do, before the kids and the mortgage and rest of life's inevitable distractions got in the way. In principal it's a good idea, but their first mistake is to attempt entry into one of Manhattan's swankiest restaurants without a reservation. Their second is far more serious: they bluff their way in, pretending to be a couple who have failed to show up for their table. Unfortunately for the Fosters, the absent diners have serious gangland connections. Even more unfortunately, the people whose identities they've adopted are due to be silenced forever by Mob hitmen. Cue a tightly plotted, gag-packed, headlong flight for survival, which has distinct echoes of the classics of the 40s screwball genre. And keep an eye out for memorable cameos from Mark Wahlberg and James Franco(n)</desc>
