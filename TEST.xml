		<desc lang="en">A series of strange murders sends shivers through a quiet New England town. It's up to a hard-as-nails police chief, Jesse Stone (Tom Selleck), to find the psychopath behind the savage crimes. Previously a homicide detective in Los Angeles, the hard-drinking Stone has the credentials to track down the serial killer. The case takes an even more sinister turn when a teenage girl is raped, and Stone realizes that catching the killer will not be so easy.(n)</desc>
