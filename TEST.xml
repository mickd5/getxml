He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private eye Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>

Aaron Green (Hill) works for a record company run by the increasingly unhinged Sergio (Sean Combs) and is a huge fan of the British rock star Aldous Snow (Brand, reprising his role from Forgetting Sarah Marshall). Sergio and Green hatch a plan for Snow to play, in just three days' time, Los Angeles's revered venue the Greek Theatre. Getting Snow from London to LA, via New York and Vegas, should be a doddle. But he's just fallen off the wagon, and the sleazy rocker's appetite for drink, drugs and attractive women complicate the journey so much that it's not clear whether Green will survive the rock star's hedonism. In addition to Combs' superbly energetic turn, Rose Byrne shines as Jackie Q, a role that satirises the record industry's fondness for marketing its female artists as sexual commodities.

		<title lang="en">Hugo (2011)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Set in 1931, Martin Scorsese's fantasy adventure, based on Brian Selznick's illustrated novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret, is a family-friendly extravaganza starring Asa Butterfield as Hugo; a lonely boy secretly living in the hidden spaces of a Parisian train station. Hugo spends his days looking after the station's clocks, trying to repair a clockwork figure belonging to his late father and evading the clutches of the station inspector, until he is befriended by Isabelle, the niece of toyshop owner Papa Georges. Alongside the youngsters' adventure (Isabelle literally holds the key to the clockwork figure's mechanism), the story of Papa Georges and his connection to the early history of cinema allows Scorsese to celebrate his own medium. Straddling the worlds of childhood exploration and adult nostalgia, the film is heartfelt and visually delightful, succeeding in balancing exuberant camerawork and broad comedy with more melancholy notes(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Predator (1987)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Dutch has a code of honor which he will not violate, even when his life depends on it. Paradoxically, his code of honor gives him the backbone to survive as a military special forces operative when he is sent on a covert mission to rescue another group which was sent in to assist some nefarious U.S. government plan in a Latin American country. Once there, he encounters an old army buddy who has gotten too deep in the CIA's good graces for Dutch's comfort. When he and his team go into the jungle to rescue the others, they get involved in a pitched battle with local guerillas, but they are more than capable of besting these vicious fighters. However, not long after that, they encounter signs that the equally capable men they were sent to rescue were all killed unawares and in an unusually gruesome fashion. Given their training, it should have been impossible for anyone to best all of these commando warriors. Soon, the men from Dutch's own team get picked off one by one, as they grow aware that they are up against something uncanny, not of this world, something that is hunting them for sport. Why? Because their skills make them worthy opponents for the perfectly camouflaged Predator(n)</desc>
