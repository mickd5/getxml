Once Stateside, his in-your-face uber-campness and total lack of self-awareness proceeds to shock, horrify and infuriate everyone he encounters - from a black TV audience, to whom he reveals his adopted African baby, via various homophobic bigots, to a memorable meeting with a Texan Congressman (who's probably still having nightmares about it). And, not willing to stop there, Brüno decides to jet off to the Middle East to solve the Arab/ Israeli conflict - to the utter horror of both parties, and risking injury or worse himself.

With nods to the Indiana Jones trilogy, Carpenter enjoys setting up one exciting, exotic set piece after another while Russell wisely reprises the all-action, wise-cracking Snake Plissken from Escape from New York to enjoyable effect(n)</desc>

Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong.

		<desc lang="en">Dutch has a code of honor which he will not violate, even when his life depends on it. Paradoxically, his code of honor gives him the backbone to survive as a military special forces operative when he is sent on a covert mission to rescue another group which was sent in to assist some nefarious U.S. government plan in a Latin American country. Once there, he encounters an old army buddy who has gotten too deep in the CIA's good graces for Dutch's comfort. When he and his team go into the jungle to rescue the others, they get involved in a pitched battle with local guerillas, but they are more than capable of besting these vicious fighters. However, not long after that, they encounter signs that the equally capable men they were sent to rescue were all killed unawares and in an unusually gruesome fashion. Given their training, it should have been impossible for anyone to best all of these commando warriors. Soon, the men from Dutch's own team get picked off one by one, as they grow aware that they are up against something uncanny, not of this world, something that is hunting them for sport. Why? Because their skills make them worthy opponents for the perfectly camouflaged Predator(n)</desc>

Phil and Claire Foster feel their marriage has gone a tad stale and decide to pep it up by going out on a date, just like they used to do, before the kids and the mortgage and rest of life's inevitable distractions got in the way. In principal it's a good idea, but their first mistake is to attempt entry into one of Manhattan's swankiest restaurants without a reservation. Their second is far more serious: they bluff their way in, pretending to be a couple who have failed to show up for their table. Unfortunately for the Fosters, the absent diners have serious gangland connections. Even more unfortunately, the people whose identities they've adopted are due to be silenced forever by Mob hitmen. Cue a tightly plotted, gag-packed, headlong flight for survival, which has distinct echoes of the classics of the 40s screwball genre. And keep an eye out for memorable cameos from Mark Wahlberg and James Franco(n)</desc>

His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist in reality, he's in for a bit of a shock. Unknown to him they do - and they take great umbrage at his slight. Thompson is whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's tried for his misdemeanour and sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. Thus he sprouts wings, is furnished with an outfit completely at odds with his usual image and is given Tracy as a (none too willing) mentor.

		<title lang="en">There's Something About Mary (1998)</title>
		<desc lang="en">After Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin, this was the Farrelly brothers' breakthrough movie, an all-round, laugh-out-loud comedy of bad taste, leavened by stand-out performances from a top-notch cast. Ben Stiller plays high school geek Ted, invited to the prom by the gorgeous Mary. He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private eye Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Get Him to the Greek (2010)</title>
		<desc lang="en">(2010) Russell Brand and Jonah Hill star in Nicholas Stoller's boisterous comedy. Aaron Green (Hill) works for a record company run by the increasingly unhinged Sergio (Sean Combs) and is a huge fan of the British rock star Aldous Snow (Brand, reprising his role from Forgetting Sarah Marshall). Sergio and Green hatch a plan for Snow to play, in just three days' time, Los Angeles's revered venue the Greek Theatre. Getting Snow from London to LA, via New York and Vegas, should be a doddle. But he's just fallen off the wagon, and the sleazy rocker's appetite for drink, drugs and attractive women complicate the journey so much that it's not clear whether Green will survive the rock star's hedonism. In addition to Combs' superbly energetic turn, Rose Byrne shines as Jackie Q, a role that satirises the record industry's fondness for marketing its female artists as sexual commodities. Also starring Elisabeth Moss, Colm Meaney and a host of real-life music icons(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">(1980) Jim Abrahams and David and Jerry Zucker's film, which launched a thousand imitators, remains the classic mould-breaking comedy. Peter Graves plays Captain Oveur, the stricken captain of a packed plane. Can passenger Ted Striker (Robert Hays) overcome the traumas he suffered as a wartime pilot and land the plane with the help of his ex-girlfriend, stewardess Elaine (Julie Hagerty) or are they all doomed? Verbal and sight gags galore lampoon every cinematic genre, with Leslie Nielsen and Robert Stack among the distinguished cast happy to make fools of themselves. And don't call me Shirley(n)</desc>

And to complicate matters, Ren falls for Moore's surviving daughter Ariel (Lori Singer), who is not as innocent as she seems. As Ren tries to persuade Moore that rock music isn't the root of all evil, a confrontation with both his daughter and the more bigoted members of his congregation give him food for thought in this classic feel-good film.
