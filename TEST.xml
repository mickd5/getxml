When the women of Rosman University's Theta Pi house throw a wild party, they set up Megan's boyfriend Garrett to think that he's overdosed her on a date-rape drug. Together, Garrett and Megan's friends Jessica, Chugs and Ellie take the 'corpse' off to a disused quarry for disposal. Unfortunately, at the quarry things don't go to plan and Megan is killed by accident. After a quick discussion, the shocked students decide to hide their friend's body and hope for the best. Eight months later it seems as though they have managed to get away with their crime. But, on the night of Theta Pi's graduation party, it becomes suddenly, violently clear that someone hasn't forgotten the sorority sisters' misdeed, and is out for bloody revenge on everyone involved in Megan's manslaughter(n)</desc>

But to do so, he has to contend with his ex-wife's animosity and Kim's new step-father's wealth. So when he has an opportunity to advance Kim's pop star ambitions he jumps at the chance, even if that means her and a friend crossing the Atlantic to brave 'the dangers of Europe'. As things turn out, he has a point: in Paris, the two girls are kidnapped by vicious Eastern European sex traffickers. As they are being abducted, Bryan tells one of the baddies, via Kim's mobile phone: 'I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you'. He subsequently does his best to make good on his promise, using all the violent tricks of the trade his time at the CIA taught him(n)</desc>
