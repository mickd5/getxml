He wants her for her unique green eyes, rare among Chinese women, to rejuvenate his spirit, and Burton has just hours to track down his lair and free Yin. With nods to the Indiana Jones trilogy, Carpenter enjoys setting up one exciting, exotic set piece after another while Russell wisely reprises the all-action, wise-cracking Snake Plissken from Escape from New York to enjoyable effect(n)</desc>

Kurt Russell plays Jack Burton, who agrees to pick up a friend's girlfriend from the airport. But when Miao Yin is kidnapped in front of him, Burton finds she's been abducted by sorcerer Lo Pan, the host of the spirit of an ancient Chinese warlord. He wants her for her unique green eyes, rare among Chinese women, to rejuvenate his spirit, and Burton has just hours to track down his lair and free Yin. With nods to the Indiana Jones trilogy, Carpenter enjoys setting up one exciting, exotic set piece after another while Russell wisely reprises the all-action, wise-cracking Snake Plissken from Escape from New York to enjoyable effect(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Post-apocalyptic action about a solitary warrior who fights to protect the last known copy of a powerful book. Decades after a nuclear war, a lone man calling himself Eli trudges through the dilapidated cities and scorched wilderness of America, carrying his copy of the Bible, a sacred book that provides 'contentment for the weak-minded'. On an odyssey to bring the text to a sacred place, Eli brings God's wrath down on the robbers, murderers and rapists who lie in wait along the highways. Driven by faith and divine calling, Eli's endeavour becomes harder when he meets the power-hungry Carnegie, who tutors an army of psychopathic rogues and gunmen in a small town. Hoping to steal the book he believes is his last chance to rule what is left of humanity, Carnegie sets out to catch Eli, while Carnegie's step-daughter also follows Eli on his quest. As Carnegie and his henchmen hunt Eli down, they soon discover what a powerful and fearsome adversary he really is(n)</desc>

It turns out that while his mum Sally (Catherine Keener) is human, his father (Kevin McKidd) is the Greek god of the sea and earthquakes, Poseidon; which makes our hero a demigod. At first it's all a bit much to take in, as he learns the modern world is teeming with deities and their offspring. And things take a turn for the worse when Zeus (Sean Bean) suspects Percy of theft after the lightning bolt that confers supreme, terrifying power goes missing. With his mother kidnapped and the errant super weapon threatening to cause a catastrophic clash of the gods, Percy sets off to recover the artefact. As he does so, he discovers the many creatures and monsters of legend are also alive today, and are as fierce as ever. Also starring Pierce Brosnan (as a centaur), Uma Thurman (as Medusa) and Steve Coogan (as Hades)(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Our Family Wedding (2010)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Lance Gross and Ugly Betty star America Ferrara take the lead roles in this warring-families romcom directed by Rick Famuyiwa. Latina Lucia Ramirez and African American Marcus Boyd met and fell in love while they were in college. Marcus has now graduated from Columbia Medical School and is due to take up a post in Laos, so the couple - who have been living together and got engaged without telling their respective families - have decided the time is right to tie the knot. However, this comes as an unpleasant surprise to the lovers' fathers, who have already met under unfortunate circumstances and traded racial abuse with each other. Can Lucia and Marcus calm things down before their big day? Well, even if they do, they'll also have to contend with a goat that has consumed a certain brand of little blue pills and whose libido has gone through the roof... Also starring Forest Whitaker and Latino comedian Carlos Mencia as the two ill-tempered and competitive dads(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">There's Something About Mary (1998)</title>
		<desc lang="en">After Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin, this was the Farrelly brothers' breakthrough movie, an all-round, laugh-out-loud comedy of bad taste, leavened by stand-out performances from a top-notch cast. Ben Stiller plays high school geek Ted, invited to the prom by the gorgeous Mary. He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private eye Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>
