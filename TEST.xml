		<desc lang="en">Jeremy, Richard and James head to Italy for a series of challenges and loud arguments to determine what is the world's best hot hatchback. The boys are in Italy to test (or play with) three high performance hatchbacks: the Renaultsport Clio 200 Cup, Citroën DS3 Racing and Fiat 500C Abarth. After winding their way through various Italian towns, they find&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; themselves on the streets of Monte Carlo during the grand prix week-end.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br class="_hidden" /    &gt;&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br class="_hidden" /    &gt;&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; On the track, James drives the Aston Martin Virage and Ross Noble is the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car.&lt;/span&gt;.(n)</desc>

		<sub-title lang="en">Episode 2</sub-title>
		<desc lang="en">The series continues with a jam-packed show featuring Italian sports cars, military manoeuvres and a trip to Belgium. Richard Hammond is on the shores of Lake Como testing the exciting new Alfa Romeo 4C, a mid-engined machine from one of the world's most beloved sports car makers. Hammond's enjoyment of the super-lightweight, 237 horsepower beauty is brought to a halt by the arrival of Jeremy Clarkson on a quad bike, demanding a race to the far end of the vast lake. Elsewhere in the programme, Clarkson is in the genteel surroundings of Bruge and at the rather less sedate Spa Grand Prix track in order to test a thrilling new breed of hybrid hypercar: the stunning, 904 horsepower McLaren P1. Meanwhile, James May is at the vast Camp Bastion in Afghanistan looking at the incredible efforts behind the army's largest vehicle redeployment since the Second World War. Finally, actor Tom Hiddleston, tries his hand out on the track as the Star in the Reasonably Priced Car. Richard drives the Alfa Romeo 4C in the pleasant surrounding of Lake Como in Italy. Things take an &lt;em&gt;unpleasant&lt;/em&gt; turn when Jeremy arrives and challenges him to a race against a quad bike. As well as&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; annoying Richard, Jeremy is in Belgium to drive the 900bhp electric, turbo charged McLaren P1 around Spa-Francochamps. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br class="_hidden" /    &gt;&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt;James has been deployed to Camp Bastion, in Afghanistan, to play with/look at Military vehicles.&lt;/span&gt;.(n)</desc>

With Clarkson in a Volkswagen Up, Hammond in a Ford Fiesta and May in a Dacia Sandero the trio zoom around the Crimean Peninsula absorbing some local history, visiting an old Soviet submarine pen and enjoying their manoeuvrable, economical cars to the full.
