		<title lang="en">Tooth Fairy (2010)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Dwayne Johnson stars in Michael Lembeck's family fantasy comedy about a tough-guy sportsman who learns the hard way not to puncture a child's illusions. Derek Thompson is an ice hockey pro whose main tactical use is the flattening of opponents - often depriving them of a tooth or two in the process. His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist in reality, he's in for a bit of a shock. Unknown to him they do - and they take great umbrage at his slight. Thompson is whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's tried for his misdemeanour and sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. Thus he sprouts wings, is furnished with an outfit completely at odds with his usual image and is given Tracy as a (none too willing) mentor. And, as the comedic misunderstandings and slapstick errors steadily mount, it's clear Thompson wasn't cut out for his new line of work(n)</desc>

Paradoxically, his code of honor gives him the backbone to survive as a military special forces operative when he is sent on a covert mission to rescue another group which was sent in to assist some nefarious U.S. government plan in a Latin American country. Once there, he encounters an old army buddy who has gotten too deep in the CIA's good graces for Dutch's comfort. When he and his team go into the jungle to rescue the others, they get involved in a pitched battle with local guerillas, but they are more than capable of besting these vicious fighters. However, not long after that, they encounter signs that the equally capable men they were sent to rescue were all killed unawares and in an unusually gruesome fashion. Given their training, it should have been impossible for anyone to best all of these commando warriors. Soon, the men from Dutch's own team get picked off one by one, as they grow aware that they are up against something uncanny, not of this world, something that is hunting them for sport. Why? Because their skills make them worthy opponents for the perfectly camouflaged Predator(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Director Scott Derrickson's remake of the 1951 sci-fi classic replaces the original's theme of fear of impending nuclear war with current concerns for environmental catastrophe. Keanu Reeves stars as Klaatu, an alien sent by a confederation of extraterrestrial beings to warn the inhabitants of Earth that the biosphere is on the verge of collapse. Predictably, as soon as he emerges from his spaceship a trigger-happy soldier ignores his instructions and takes a shot at the visitor. The wounded Klaatu asks for access to the United Nations to deliver his message, but the Secretary of Defence, Regina Jackson, instead orders that he should be taken away for further investigations. Klaatu becomes increasingly convinced that Earth can only survive if mankind is eradicated..(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Predator (1987)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Dutch has a code of honor which he will not violate, even when his life depends on it. Paradoxically, his code of honor gives him the backbone to survive as a military special forces operative when he is sent on a covert mission to rescue another group which was sent in to assist some nefarious U.S. government plan in a Latin American country. Once there, he encounters an old army buddy who has gotten too deep in the CIA's good graces for Dutch's comfort. When he and his team go into the jungle to rescue the others, they get involved in a pitched battle with local guerillas, but they are more than capable of besting these vicious fighters. However, not long after that, they encounter signs that the equally capable men they were sent to rescue were all killed unawares and in an unusually gruesome fashion. Given their training, it should have been impossible for anyone to best all of these commando warriors. Soon, the men from Dutch's own team get picked off one by one, as they grow aware that they are up against something uncanny, not of this world, something that is hunting them for sport. Why? Because their skills make them worthy opponents for the perfectly camouflaged Predator(n)</desc>

Each summer a bunch of greedy grasshoppers descends demanding food, which the peace-loving ants grudgingly supply. Then one year a rebel ant called Flik decides to enlist the help of an unemployed troupe of bug performers from a second rate flea circus to fight the intruders. It's a great idea, but doesn't quite work out the way he planned.... Star voices include Kevin Spacey and the late Roddy McDowall in this great family film. Ant-icipate enjoyment!(n)</desc>

Each summer a bunch of greedy grasshoppers descends demanding food, which the peace-loving ants grudgingly supply. Then one year a rebel ant called Flik decides to enlist the help of an unemployed troupe of bug performers from a second rate flea circus to fight the intruders. It's a great idea, but doesn't quite work out the way he planned.... Star voices include Kevin Spacey and the late Roddy McDowall in this great family film. Ant-icipate enjoyment!(n)</desc>
