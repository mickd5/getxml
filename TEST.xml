		<desc lang="en">For decades Gus Lobel (Clint Eastwood) has been one of baseball's best scouts -- but now his age is catching up with him. Still, he refuses to be benched even though his bosses are questioning his judgment. Tasked with checking out the country's hottest batting prospect, Gus is forced to accept help from his daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams). Though they haven't spent time together in years, father and daughter make new discoveries about their shared past, which could change their future.(n)</desc>

Rick "Wild Thing" Vaughn (Charlie Sheen) does lucrative endorsements, but his killer fastball is gone, while once-aggressive slugger Pedro Cerrano (Dennis Haysbert) has become a laid-back Buddhist. But, as the players realize they've all gone astray, they rally for a shot at the World Series.(n)</desc>

Hugh Bonneville appears. As they advance in years, Jeremy, James and Richard come over all nostalgic for the hot hatchbacks of their youth. To prove the pocket rockets of yesteryear were better than the present days versions, they take&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; a Volkswagen Golf GTI, Ford Fiesta XR2i and a Vauxhall Nova SR1 (?!?) on a road trip that concludes at an army training ground in Wales.

		<sub-title lang="en">Episode 2</sub-title>
		<desc lang="en">The series continues with a jam-packed show featuring Italian sports cars, military manoeuvres and a trip to Belgium. Richard Hammond is on the shores of Lake Como testing the exciting new Alfa Romeo 4C, a mid-engined machine from one of the world's most beloved sports car makers. Hammond's enjoyment of the super-lightweight, 237 horsepower beauty is brought to a halt by the arrival of Jeremy Clarkson on a quad bike, demanding a race to the far end of the vast lake. Elsewhere in the programme, Clarkson is in the genteel surroundings of Bruge and at the rather less sedate Spa Grand Prix track in order to test a thrilling new breed of hybrid hypercar: the stunning, 904 horsepower McLaren P1. Meanwhile, James May is at the vast Camp Bastion in Afghanistan looking at the incredible efforts behind the army's largest vehicle redeployment since the Second World War. Finally, actor Tom Hiddleston, tries his hand out on the track as the Star in the Reasonably Priced Car. Richard drives the Alfa Romeo 4C in the pleasant surrounding of Lake Como in Italy. Things take an &lt;em&gt;unpleasant&lt;/em&gt; turn when Jeremy arrives and challenges him to a race against a quad bike. As well as&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; annoying Richard, Jeremy is in Belgium to drive the 900bhp electric, turbo charged McLaren P1 around Spa-Francochamps. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br class="_hidden" /    &gt;&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt;James has been deployed to Camp Bastion, in Afghanistan, to play with/look at Military vehicles.&lt;/span&gt;.(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May demonstrate their love for compact, small-engined cars with a trip to the Ukraine. With Clarkson in a Volkswagen Up, Hammond in a Ford Fiesta and May in a Dacia Sandero the trio zoom around the Crimean Peninsula absorbing some local history, visiting an old Soviet submarine pen and enjoying their manoeuvrable, economical cars to the full. Unfortunately, their carefree time is curtailed when they are challenged to a vast drive, heading north across one of the largest countries in Europe and must take any step necessary to fight the immense boredom of a long car journey. Eventually, the three arrive in Kiev only to receive one final and truly fearsome challenge. Jeremy, James and Richard embark on a road trip in three small cars to Ukraine. Jeremy has chosen to make the journey in a Volkswagen Up!, Richard drives the Ford Fiesta and James - realising a&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; long-held ambition - drives the Dacia Sandero. During their visit they travel to the Crimean Peninsula and the even more infamous Chernobyl.&lt;/span&gt;.(n)</desc>
