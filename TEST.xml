		<desc lang="en">Director Joe Carnahan's big-screen take, co-produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, on the 80s TV series, which was an OTT action-fest that, at the same time, gloried in and poked fun at its tough-guy stars and their adventures. This time around, a little brasher and more serious than their first incarnation, the team of soldiers comprises the cigar-chomping Col 'Hannibal' Smith, the wilfully eccentric Murdock, toned babe-magnet Face and, of course, BA Baracus, who famously 'pities the fool', usually with more forceful fisticuffing than is strictly necessary. Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar.

		<title lang="en">The A-Team (2010)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Director Joe Carnahan's big-screen take, co-produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, on the 80s TV series, which was an OTT action-fest that, at the same time, gloried in and poked fun at its tough-guy stars and their adventures. This time around, a little brasher and more serious than their first incarnation, the team of soldiers comprises the cigar-chomping Col 'Hannibal' Smith, the wilfully eccentric Murdock, toned babe-magnet Face and, of course, BA Baracus, who famously 'pities the fool', usually with more forceful fisticuffing than is strictly necessary. Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar. And, of course, blowing up as many objects as possible along the way. Also featuring Jessica Biel as Face's former flame and Patrick Wilson as the team's CIA handler(n)</desc>

Inglourious Basterds features the entertainingly showy performances, encyclopaedic movie references and oodles of self-conscious dialogue that you'd expect from a Tarantino film, as well as a superb turn from Christoph Waltz as a charmingly evil SS colonel.

Derek Thompson is an ice hockey pro whose main tactical use is the flattening of opponents - often depriving them of a tooth or two in the process. His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist in reality, he's in for a bit of a shock. Unknown to him they do - and they take great umbrage at his slight. Thompson is whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's tried for his misdemeanour and sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. Thus he sprouts wings, is furnished with an outfit completely at odds with his usual image and is given Tracy as a (none too willing) mentor. And, as the comedic misunderstandings and slapstick errors steadily mount, it's clear Thompson wasn't cut out for his new line of work(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Sunshine (2007)</title>
		<desc lang="en">(2007) Danny Boyle's science-fiction epic is set 50 years in the future. The sun is dying, Earth suffers a perpetual winter and humanity's only hope is a spaceship that will deliver an atomic device into the heart of the Sun to 'kickstart' it again. Icarus II (Icarus I, the previous attempt, went missing years after launch) is captained by Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada), with Capa (Cillian Murphy), a physicist, and Corazon (Michelle Yeoh) in charge of the ship's environment. But as Icarus II approaches Mercury, it begins to receive signals from Icarus I, and when they board the supposedly lost craft, they encounter an entity that endangers the whole mission. Sunshine is written by Alex Garland, who also collaborated with Boyle on 28 Days Later. M,W,R,S,(n)</desc>

Phil and Claire Foster feel their marriage has gone a tad stale and decide to pep it up by going out on a date, just like they used to do, before the kids and the mortgage and rest of life's inevitable distractions got in the way. In principal it's a good idea, but their first mistake is to attempt entry into one of Manhattan's swankiest restaurants without a reservation. Their second is far more serious: they bluff their way in, pretending to be a couple who have failed to show up for their table. Unfortunately for the Fosters, the absent diners have serious gangland connections. Even more unfortunately, the people whose identities they've adopted are due to be silenced forever by Mob hitmen. Cue a tightly plotted, gag-packed, headlong flight for survival, which has distinct echoes of the classics of the 40s screwball genre.

		<desc lang="en">After Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin, this was the Farrelly brothers' breakthrough movie, an all-round, laugh-out-loud comedy of bad taste, leavened by stand-out performances from a top-notch cast. Ben Stiller plays high school geek Ted, invited to the prom by the gorgeous Mary. He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private eye Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>

At first the game appears routine: On the U.S. Naval Base located at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, two Marines conduct a seemingly unauthorised punishment on a fellow Marine who has broken the chain of command by writing a letter to an off-base authority, threatening to report one of them for an illegal shooting over the fenceline in exchange for a transfer(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Tsotsi and Rendition director Gavin Hood's fantasy adventure explores the backstory of the most hirsute and mercurial of the X-Men: Wolverine. The tale kicks off in 1845 with the incident that sparked the young James Howlett's initial mutation and his alliance with Victor Creed. Over the course of the next century the two immerse themselves in a series of major conflicts, right up to the Vietnam War, where they are recruited by Major Stryker to join Team X: a killing machine staffed by other mutants. Uncomfortable with the merciless, legally dubious methods the unit employs, Howlett leaves, seeking a quiet life. Over the course of the next few years, Howlett, now known as Logan, seems to have realised his dream, having settled down with his girlfriend Kayla. However, a violent, catastrophic incident turns Logan's world upside down, propelling him on a course that will result in confrontation with his former ally Creed, as well as Logan's final transmogrification into Wolverine. Also starring Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch and Will.i.am(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Tsotsi and Rendition director Gavin Hood's fantasy adventure explores the backstory of the most hirsute and mercurial of the X-Men: Wolverine. The tale kicks off in 1845 with the incident that sparked the young James Howlett's initial mutation and his alliance with Victor Creed. Over the course of the next century the two immerse themselves in a series of major conflicts, right up to the Vietnam War, where they are recruited by Major Stryker to join Team X: a killing machine staffed by other mutants. Uncomfortable with the merciless, legally dubious methods the unit employs, Howlett leaves, seeking a quiet life. Over the course of the next few years, Howlett, now known as Logan, seems to have realised his dream, having settled down with his girlfriend Kayla. However, a violent, catastrophic incident turns Logan's world upside down, propelling him on a course that will result in confrontation with his former ally Creed, as well as Logan's final transmogrification into Wolverine. Also starring Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch and Will.i.am(n)</desc>
