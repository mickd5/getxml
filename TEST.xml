As they advance in years, Jeremy, James and Richard come over all nostalgic for the hot hatchbacks of their youth. To prove the pocket rockets of yesteryear were better than the present days versions, they take&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; a Volkswagen Golf GTI, Ford Fiesta XR2i and a Vauxhall Nova SR1 (?!?) on a road trip that concludes at an army training ground in Wales.

		<desc lang="en">Jeremy Clarkson celebrates the 50th birthday of the Jaguar E-type by driving a modern, half a million pound interpretation of this classic sports car before putting on a typically low key birthday party involving live music, classic fighter planes and a group of Royal Marines. Meanwhile, Richard Hammond is in South Africa to test a bigger, even more rugged alternative to the famous Hummer, while James May meets up with gold medal-winning British Olympian Amy Williams for a wintry test of the latest Mini rally car. Plus, the power-crazed BMW 1-series M is on the test track and another top celebrity guest takes their place in the Reasonably Priced Car. The 50th birthday of the Jaguar E-Type is marked, by Jeremy, in typically brash style. The BMW 1M is on the track and James gets to play with Olympic gold medallist Amy Williams... and a Mini&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; rally car. Jeremy drives the Eagle Speedster, whilst Richard travels to South Africa to play with the Marauder; something even bigger, louder and more destructive than Jeremy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br class="_hidden" /    &gt;&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br class="_hidden" /    &gt;&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; Alice Cooper is the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car.&lt;/span&gt;.(n)</desc>

And it's straight down to supercar business with Richard driving the £800,000 Pagani Huayra. James, rather appropriately, is in a Bentley. Rather inappropriately, he's in a Continental&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; GT Speed and he takes it rallying. Meanwhile, Jeremy, the word's tallest motoring Journalist, has built the world's smallest car.&lt;/span&gt;.(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Jeremy Clarkson celebrates the 50th birthday of the Jaguar E-type by driving a modern, half a million pound interpretation of this classic sports car before putting on a typically low key birthday party involving live music, classic fighter planes and a group of Royal Marines. Meanwhile, Richard Hammond is in South Africa to test a bigger, even more rugged alternative to the famous Hummer, while James May meets up with gold medal-winning British Olympian Amy Williams for a wintry test of the latest Mini rally car. Plus, the power-crazed BMW 1-series M is on the test track and another top celebrity guest takes their place in the Reasonably Priced Car. The 50th birthday of the Jaguar E-Type is marked, by Jeremy, in typically brash style. The BMW 1M is on the track and James gets to play with Olympic gold medallist Amy Williams... and a Mini&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; rally car. Jeremy drives the Eagle Speedster, whilst Richard travels to South Africa to play with the Marauder; something even bigger, louder and more destructive than Jeremy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br class="_hidden" /    &gt;&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br class="_hidden" /    &gt;&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; Alice Cooper is the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car.&lt;/span&gt;.(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">The manic motoring magazine returns as Messrs Clarkson, Hammond and May take on a hatchback challenge. Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville is the Star in the Reasonably Priced Car. As they advance in years, Jeremy, James and Richard come over all nostalgic for the hot hatchbacks of their youth. To prove the pocket rockets of yesteryear were better than the present days versions, they take&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; a Volkswagen Golf GTI, Ford Fiesta XR2i and a Vauxhall Nova SR1 (?!?) on a road trip that concludes at an army training ground in Wales. Expect gunfire.&lt;/span&gt;.(n)</desc>

Meanwhile, back in the studio, legendary Fleetwood Mac drummer Mick Fleetwood is the star in the Reasonably Priced Car. This week the boys are in the western United States.
