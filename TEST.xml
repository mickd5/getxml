Following a disastrous incident involving a Velcro jump suit at Milan Fashion Week, Brüno is fired from his TV show Funkyzeit mit Brüno, turns his back on the fashion, and heads off to America, hoping to become more famous than Hitler (though for different reasons, naturally). Once Stateside, his in-your-face uber-campness and total lack of self-awareness proceeds to shock, horrify and infuriate everyone he encounters - from a black TV audience, to whom he reveals his adopted African baby, via various homophobic bigots, to a memorable meeting with a Texan Congressman (who's probably still having nightmares about it). And, not willing to stop there, Brüno decides to jet off to the Middle East to solve the Arab/ Israeli conflict - to the utter horror of both parties, and risking injury or worse himself. Opinions are divided over whether Brüno is out to expose the idiocy of homophobia, or whether he's simply using it for laughs.

In principal it's a good idea, but their first mistake is to attempt entry into one of Manhattan's swankiest restaurants without a reservation. Their second is far more serious: they bluff their way in, pretending to be a couple who have failed to show up for their table. Unfortunately for the Fosters, the absent diners have serious gangland connections. Even more unfortunately, the people whose identities they've adopted are due to be silenced forever by Mob hitmen. Cue a tightly plotted, gag-packed, headlong flight for survival, which has distinct echoes of the classics of the 40s screwball genre.
