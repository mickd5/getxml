Things go badly wrong for Richard the Lionheart and his men during their return from crusade in the Holy Land. One of the King's soldiers who escapes with his life is archer Robin Longstride, who adopts the persona of the recently slain Robin of Loxley in order to get back to the safety of England. Back on home soil, Robin makes his way to the Loxley estate in order to hand back the dead man's sword. But he's not only greeted with gratitude, he's also unexpectedly invited to continue living his double life, including cohabiting with Loxley's widow, the strong, independent Marion. It may look as though he's landed on his feet, but there's a dark cloud on the horizon in the form of the slippery, villainous Sir Godfrey - who is simultaneously out to squeeze more taxes from the population to fund the playboy lifestyle of Prince John, while also treacherously laying the ground for a second French invasion of Britain(n)</desc>

Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar. And, of course, blowing up as many objects as possible along the way. Also featuring Jessica Biel as Face's former flame and Patrick Wilson as the team's CIA handler(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">(2010) This family adventure from Chris Columbus (who directed the first two Harry Potter films) is adapted from the first of Rick Riordan's series of fantasy novels, and stars Logan Lerman as Percy Jackson, an American teen who finds that Greek myth is much closer to home than he imagined. It turns out that while his mum Sally (Catherine Keener) is human, his father (Kevin McKidd) is the Greek god of the sea and earthquakes, Poseidon; which makes our hero a demigod. At first it's all a bit much to take in, as he learns the modern world is teeming with deities and their offspring. And things take a turn for the worse when Zeus (Sean Bean) suspects Percy of theft after the lightning bolt that confers supreme, terrifying power goes missing. With his mother kidnapped and the errant super weapon threatening to cause a catastrophic clash of the gods, Percy sets off to recover the artefact. As he does so, he discovers the many creatures and monsters of legend are also alive today, and are as fierce as ever. Also starring Pierce Brosnan (as a centaur), Uma Thurman (as Medusa) and Steve Coogan (as Hades)(n)</desc>

His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist in reality, he's in for a bit of a shock. Unknown to him they do - and they take great umbrage at his slight. Thompson is whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's tried for his misdemeanour and sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. Thus he sprouts wings, is furnished with an outfit completely at odds with his usual image and is given Tracy as a (none too willing) mentor.
