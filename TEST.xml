		<desc lang="en">The series continues with a jam-packed show featuring Italian sports cars, military manoeuvres and a trip to Belgium. Richard Hammond is on the shores of Lake Como testing the exciting new Alfa Romeo 4C, a mid-engined machine from one of the world's most beloved sports car makers. Hammond's enjoyment of the super-lightweight, 237 horsepower beauty is brought to a halt by the arrival of Jeremy Clarkson on a quad bike, demanding a race to the far end of the vast lake. Elsewhere in the programme, Clarkson is in the genteel surroundings of Bruge and at the rather less sedate Spa Grand Prix track in order to test a thrilling new breed of hybrid hypercar: the stunning, 904 horsepower McLaren P1. Meanwhile, James May is at the vast Camp Bastion in Afghanistan looking at the incredible efforts behind the army's largest vehicle redeployment since the Second World War. Finally, actor Tom Hiddleston, tries his hand out on the track as the Star in the Reasonably Priced Car. Richard drives the Alfa Romeo 4C in the pleasant surrounding of Lake Como in Italy. Things take an &lt;em&gt;unpleasant&lt;/em&gt; turn when Jeremy arrives and challenges him to a race against a quad bike. As well as&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; annoying Richard, Jeremy is in Belgium to drive the 900bhp electric, turbo charged McLaren P1 around Spa-Francochamps. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br class="_hidden" /    &gt;&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt;James has been deployed to Camp Bastion, in Afghanistan, to play with/look at Military vehicles.&lt;/span&gt;.(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">The team is on an epic road trip across the western side of the United States in three front-engined supercars. With Jeremy Clarkson in a Lexus LFA, Richard Hammond driving the new Dodge Viper and James May choosing the latest Aston Martin Vanquish a glorious soundtrack is guaranteed, as are furious arguments about which is best as the trio head from Las Vegas to Los Angeles and on to Palm Springs. Along the way, the three presenters take in racing circuits, airborne attacks and a race against the police before making a break for the Mexican border with a terrifying penalty for the last car to make it. Meanwhile, back in the studio, legendary Fleetwood Mac drummer Mick Fleetwood is the star in the Reasonably Priced Car. This week the boys are in the western United States. Travelling from Las Vegas to Los Angeles via Palm Springs, they make their journey in three front-engined supercars: the Lexus LFA, Dodge Viper and the Aston&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; Martin Vanquish. The trip involves a race against the police and a dash to the Mexican border, where the last man to arrive faces a 'terrifying' penalty.&lt;/span&gt;.(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Jeremy Clarkson celebrates the 50th birthday of the Jaguar E-type by driving a modern, half a million pound interpretation of this classic sports car before putting on a typically low key birthday party involving live music, classic fighter planes and a group of Royal Marines. Meanwhile, Richard Hammond is in South Africa to test a bigger, even more rugged alternative to the famous Hummer, while James May meets up with gold medal-winning British Olympian Amy Williams for a wintry test of the latest Mini rally car. Plus, the power-crazed BMW 1-series M is on the test track and another top celebrity guest takes their place in the Reasonably Priced Car. The 50th birthday of the Jaguar E-Type is marked, by Jeremy, in typically brash style. The BMW 1M is on the track and James gets to play with Olympic gold medallist Amy Williams... and a Mini&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; rally car. Jeremy drives the Eagle Speedster, whilst Richard travels to South Africa to play with the Marauder; something even bigger, louder and more destructive than Jeremy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br class="_hidden" /    &gt;&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br class="_hidden" /    &gt;&lt;span class="_hidden"&gt; Alice Cooper is the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car.&lt;/span&gt;.(n)</desc>
