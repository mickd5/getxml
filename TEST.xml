		<sub-title lang="en">The Triumph Stag</sub-title>
		<desc lang="en">The Triumph Stag is a car that represents the best and worst of British motoring. Launched in 1970 with continental good looks and a punchy V8 engine, it was the perfect car for the G&amp;T set. With more than a hint of the middle-aged playboy about its design, the glamour faded rather quickly as the car became synonymous with overheating engines and unexpected breakdowns and ceased production after seven years. Philip Glenister and Ant Anstead hope to find, rescue and rehabilitate a Stag back to better than new. Ant finds one under a tarpaulin at the back of a scrapyard. Philip meets members of the Stag owners' club in an attempt to understand whether the Stag's reputation for unreliability is fair. From a European road trip with comedian and motoring journalist Alexei Sayle, that almost ends on the back of a recovery truck, to pitting the Stag against one of the greatest cars ever built, the Jaguar E-Type, in a battle of the best sounding engines, Phil and Ant come to a surprising conclusion about the Stag.(n)</desc>

		<sub-title lang="en">Land Rover Series I</sub-title>
		<desc lang="en">Philip Glenister and car designer Ant Anstead scour the barns and lock ups of Britain for wrecked treasures to bring to life. The Land Rover Series I is a seriously iconic British car. Born in 1948 it went on to conquer the world. Rugged, simple, but with only just 39,000 ever made, examples of this national treasure of automotive pride are getting harder and harder to find. It's down to Philip Glenister and internationally renowned car designer Ant Anstead to find, rescue and restore a Landie back to as good as new. Unfortunately the only example they can get their hands on has been sitting in a barn for over 41 years - un-driven, unloved and covered in cat poo. Philip meets the fanatical Landie lovers who eat, drink and sleep these cars - from trialers who gather in damp woods early on Sunday mornings to thrash their cars in the most basic form of motor sport, to a real life Lawrence of Arabia who depended on the Series 1 to keep him alive in the desert. And there's a flash mob where Philip and Ant's refurbed Landie is judged by the hardest critics of all - other Land Rover owners.(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">This coming-of-age film follows the mayhem of group of rowdy teenagers in Austin, Texas, celebrating the last day of high school in 1976. The graduating class heads for a popular pool hall and joins an impromptu keg party, however star football player Randall "Pink" Floyd (Jason London) has promised to focus on the championship game and abstain from partying. Meanwhile, the incoming freshmen try to avoid being hazed by the seniors, most notably the sadistic bully Fred O'Bannion (Ben Affleck).(n)</desc>
