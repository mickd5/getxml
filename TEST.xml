		<desc lang="en">The Devil Wears Prada director David Frankel's light comedy-drama - based on a best-selling autobiography - stars Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston as a pair of married journalists who welcome a truly unruly dog into their livesRelocating to Florida, newlyweds John and Jenny Grogan end up working for rival newspapers, and it's soon obvious that Jenny has landed the more high-profile jobBut when she starts to become broody, one of John's colleagues suggests they see how they cope with a puppy before trying for a babyJohn duly picks a cute yellow Labrador Retriever as a gift for his spouseIt's quickly clear their acquisition is something of a double-edged sword: he's an untrainably anarchic source of destruction; but he also gives John the material for a wry newspaper column, which greatly increases his standing.The film follows the trajectory of the Grogans' marriage, through good times and bad, and the stuff of everyday life, with the dog providing comic relief and the leads turning in convincing, heart-warming performances.(n)</desc>
