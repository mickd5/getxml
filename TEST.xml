Bereft, and with her boyfriend Jeremy Davies unable to fulfil her desires, she plans to win back Spader's affections.

Ben Stiller plays high school geek Ted, invited to the prom by the gorgeous Mary. He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private eye Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Mr. Popper's Penguins (2011)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Jim Carrey stars in director Mark Waters' family comedy, loosely based on a classic children's book. Tom Popper is a New York property shark with a failed marriage and a strained relationship with his kids. Popper's own father was an explorer, usually absent while Tom was growing up. That could be reason for Tom's emotional disengagement, but his father certainly is the reason Tom ends up receiving a crate of six gentoo penguins - a bequest from the old man's deathbed. Manhattan isn't the obvious place in which to care for the birds, but not only does Popper quickly bond with his charges, his adventures with them also act as a springboard for possible reconciliation with his family - as well as ample opportunity for Carrey to ply his trademarked rubber-faced, flexed-limbed comedic turn. The penguins are real ones, their antics only enhanced rather than generated by CGI. And the only dark cloud on his horizon is the zoo's Nat Jones, who believes the creatures would be better off with him than in Popper's apartment. Also starring Ophelia Lovibond as Popper's assistant Pippi(n)</desc>
