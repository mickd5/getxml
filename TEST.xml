		<desc lang="en">Director Joe Carnahan's big-screen take, co-produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, on the 80s TV series, which was an OTT action-fest that, at the same time, gloried in and poked fun at its tough-guy stars and their adventures. This time around, a little brasher and more serious than their first incarnation, the team of soldiers comprises the cigar-chomping Col 'Hannibal' Smith, the wilfully eccentric Murdock, toned babe-magnet Face and, of course, BA Baracus, who famously 'pities the fool', usually with more forceful fisticuffing than is strictly necessary. Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar. And, of course, blowing up as many objects as possible along the way. Also featuring Jessica Biel as Face's former flame and Patrick Wilson as the team's CIA handler(n)</desc>

Renegade Khan has escaped from the prison planet on which Kirk imprisoned him in the TV series. Bent on revenge, Khan steals the Genesis device, which can destroy planets, and lures Kirk and the USS Enterprise into a trap. At the same time, Kirk's son David Marcus and ex-lover Carol Marcus, who invented the device, become part of the trap and Kirk must make some of the hardest choices of his career. As well as the regular crew - Spock, Dr McCoy and Chekov - the ship is joined by Lt Saavik (the excellent Kirstie Alley), Spock's half-Vulcan protégé. The action is fast-moving and Kirk's eventual victory is tinged with poignancy as one individual makes the ultimate sacrifice. Edited for violence(n)</desc>

The science of robotics is so advanced that humanoid-looking servants have been developed, ready to obey any command from a human. When the chief designer of US Robotics, the biggest manufacturer of this new brand, is found dead in the company's atrium after a fall from the upper floor, it has all the hallmarks of suicide, and Chicago cop Del Spooner is assigned to the case. But, because of a previous trauma, Spooner is a technophobe and doesn't believe that all robots are harmless. Despite opposition from both his superiors and the company, he investigates further and soon his suspicions centre on one robot, Sonny (voiced by Alan Tudyk). Is "he" one of an army of conscious, violent robots ready to challenge their human masters?(n)</desc>

Two young Marines stand accused of murdering a member of their platoon during an unsanctioned disciplinary action known as a "Code Red". The Navy, in an effort to obtain a quick and quiet plea bargain, appoints Lieutenant J.G.Daniel Kaffee, a young, second generation Navy lawyer, to defend the accused Marines. Less than fifteen months out of Harvard Law School, Kaffee has earned a reputation for his glibness and facility to plea bargain. Though possessed of a brilliant legal mind Kaffee is more interested in softball games than in the hardball game of law. At first the game appears routine: On the U.S. Naval Base located at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, two Marines conduct a seemingly unauthorised punishment on a fellow Marine who has broken the chain of command by writing a letter to an off-base authority, threatening to report one of them for an illegal shooting over the fenceline in exchange for a transfer(n)</desc>
