		<title lang="en">The A-Team (2010)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Director Joe Carnahan's big-screen take, co-produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, on the 80s TV series, which was an OTT action-fest that, at the same time, gloried in and poked fun at its tough-guy stars and their adventures. This time around, a little brasher and more serious than their first incarnation, the team of soldiers comprises the cigar-chomping Col 'Hannibal' Smith, the wilfully eccentric Murdock, toned babe-magnet Face and, of course, BA Baracus, who famously 'pities the fool', usually with more forceful fisticuffing than is strictly necessary. Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar. And, of course, blowing up as many objects as possible along the way. Also featuring Jessica Biel as Face's former flame and Patrick Wilson as the team's CIA handler(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Jennifer Aniston and Aaron Eckhart star in Brandon Camp's directorial debut, which he co-wrote with long-time collaborator Mike Thompson. The romantic drama tells the story of Burke Ryan, who wrote a best-selling self-help manual following his wife's death in a car crash three years earlier. He's currently, under the guidance of his manager Lane, touring a seminar for the bereaved, which has brought him to Seattle, his late wife's hometown. And it's here, at his hotel, that he bumps into Eloise Chandler, the local florist who supplies the establishment's flowers. He's clearly taken with her, but she's quite frosty towards him. Even so, he pursues her - but It soon transpires that, despite his new career, both he and she have a lot of emotional baggage that will need to be dealt with before a relationship is likely to succeed. Also starring Martin Sheen and John Carroll Lynch. Edited for language(n)</desc>
