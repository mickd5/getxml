In principal it's a good idea, but their first mistake is to attempt entry into one of Manhattan's swankiest restaurants without a reservation. Their second is far more serious: they bluff their way in, pretending to be a couple who have failed to show up for their table. Unfortunately for the Fosters, the absent diners have serious gangland connections. Even more unfortunately, the people whose identities they've adopted are due to be silenced forever by Mob hitmen. Cue a tightly plotted, gag-packed, headlong flight for survival, which has distinct echoes of the classics of the 40s screwball genre.

		<title lang="en">Brüno (2009)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Sacha Baron Cohen follows up his outrageous PC-busting mockumentary Borat... with this outrageous PC-busting mockumentary about a disgraced gay Austrian fashion journalist seeking fame and fortune in the US of A. Following a disastrous incident involving a Velcro jump suit at Milan Fashion Week, Brüno is fired from his TV show Funkyzeit mit Brüno, turns his back on the fashion, and heads off to America, hoping to become more famous than Hitler (though for different reasons, naturally). Once Stateside, his in-your-face uber-campness and total lack of self-awareness proceeds to shock, horrify and infuriate everyone he encounters - from a black TV audience, to whom he reveals his adopted African baby, via various homophobic bigots, to a memorable meeting with a Texan Congressman (who's probably still having nightmares about it). And, not willing to stop there, Brüno decides to jet off to the Middle East to solve the Arab/ Israeli conflict - to the utter horror of both parties, and risking injury or worse himself. Opinions are divided over whether Brüno is out to expose the idiocy of homophobia, or whether he's simply using it for laughs. However, there is consensus that this is a very, very funny film, albeit one not for the faint-hearted(n)</desc>

Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar.

		<desc lang="en">Set just three decades in the future, Alex Proyas's all-action science fiction film is inspired by Isaac Asimov's 1950s short story. The science of robotics is so advanced that humanoid-looking servants have been developed, ready to obey any command from a human. When the chief designer of US Robotics, the biggest manufacturer of this new brand, is found dead in the company's atrium after a fall from the upper floor, it has all the hallmarks of suicide, and Chicago cop Del Spooner is assigned to the case. But, because of a previous trauma, Spooner is a technophobe and doesn't believe that all robots are harmless. Despite opposition from both his superiors and the company, he investigates further and soon his suspicions centre on one robot, Sonny (voiced by Alan Tudyk). Is "he" one of an army of conscious, violent robots ready to challenge their human masters?(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Predator (1987)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Dutch has a code of honor which he will not violate, even when his life depends on it. Paradoxically, his code of honor gives him the backbone to survive as a military special forces operative when he is sent on a covert mission to rescue another group which was sent in to assist some nefarious U.S. government plan in a Latin American country. Once there, he encounters an old army buddy who has gotten too deep in the CIA's good graces for Dutch's comfort. When he and his team go into the jungle to rescue the others, they get involved in a pitched battle with local guerillas, but they are more than capable of besting these vicious fighters. However, not long after that, they encounter signs that the equally capable men they were sent to rescue were all killed unawares and in an unusually gruesome fashion. Given their training, it should have been impossible for anyone to best all of these commando warriors. Soon, the men from Dutch's own team get picked off one by one, as they grow aware that they are up against something uncanny, not of this world, something that is hunting them for sport. Why? Because their skills make them worthy opponents for the perfectly camouflaged Predator(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Miss Congeniality 2: Armed And Fabulous, the highly anticipated sequel to the surprise smash hit Miss Congeniality, homes in on FBI agent Gracie Hart shortly after she successfully disarmed a threat against the Miss United States Pageant while working undercover as a contestant. Having become a media celebrity as a result of her pageant heroics, Gracie now spends more time at the salon than the shooting range, as she works the talk show circuit to promote her book. When her pageant friends, winner Cheryl and emcee Stan, are kidnapped in Las Vegas, Gracie jumps back into action to save them, putting herself at loggerheads with the FBI top brass, who don't want to risk losing their prized mascot and who fear she might not be up to the job anymore(n)</desc>
