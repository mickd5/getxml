		<desc lang="en">Director Joe Carnahan's big-screen take, co-produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, on the 80s TV series, which was an OTT action-fest that, at the same time, gloried in and poked fun at its tough-guy stars and their adventures.

Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong.

		<title lang="en">Big Trouble in Little China (1986)</title>
		<desc lang="en">John Carpenter takes a rest from the horror genre to direct this enjoyable martial arts romp that's played firmly with its tongue in cheek. Kurt Russell plays Jack Burton, who agrees to pick up a friend's girlfriend from the airport. But when Miao Yin is kidnapped in front of him, Burton finds she's been abducted by sorcerer Lo Pan, the host of the spirit of an ancient Chinese warlord. He wants her for her unique green eyes, rare among Chinese women, to rejuvenate his spirit, and Burton has just hours to track down his lair and free Yin. With nods to the Indiana Jones trilogy, Carpenter enjoys setting up one exciting, exotic set piece after another while Russell wisely reprises the all-action, wise-cracking Snake Plissken from Escape from New York to enjoyable effect(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Big Trouble in Little China (1986)</title>
		<desc lang="en">John Carpenter takes a rest from the horror genre to direct this enjoyable martial arts romp that's played firmly with its tongue in cheek. Kurt Russell plays Jack Burton, who agrees to pick up a friend's girlfriend from the airport. But when Miao Yin is kidnapped in front of him, Burton finds she's been abducted by sorcerer Lo Pan, the host of the spirit of an ancient Chinese warlord. He wants her for her unique green eyes, rare among Chinese women, to rejuvenate his spirit, and Burton has just hours to track down his lair and free Yin. With nods to the Indiana Jones trilogy, Carpenter enjoys setting up one exciting, exotic set piece after another while Russell wisely reprises the all-action, wise-cracking Snake Plissken from Escape from New York to enjoyable effect(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Director Joe Carnahan's big-screen take, co-produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, on the 80s TV series, which was an OTT action-fest that, at the same time, gloried in and poked fun at its tough-guy stars and their adventures. This time around, a little brasher and more serious than their first incarnation, the team of soldiers comprises the cigar-chomping Col 'Hannibal' Smith, the wilfully eccentric Murdock, toned babe-magnet Face and, of course, BA Baracus, who famously 'pities the fool', usually with more forceful fisticuffing than is strictly necessary. Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar. And, of course, blowing up as many objects as possible along the way. Also featuring Jessica Biel as Face's former flame and Patrick Wilson as the team's CIA handler(n)</desc>

Once there, he encounters an old army buddy who has gotten too deep in the CIA's good graces for Dutch's comfort.

However, not long after that, they encounter signs that the equally capable men they were sent to rescue were all killed unawares and in an unusually gruesome fashion. Given their training, it should have been impossible for anyone to best all of these commando warriors.

Ben Stiller plays high school geek Ted, invited to the prom by the gorgeous Mary. He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private eye Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>
