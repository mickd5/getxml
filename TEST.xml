		<desc lang="en">Julia Roberts, Armie Hammer and Lily Collins star in Tarsem Singh's reworking of the Snow White fairy taleWhen her father the King goes missing on a quest to save his kingdom, the 18-year-old Snow White is left alone with her stepmother the Queen, who has raised the girl since her natural mother died giving birth to herThis devotion should not be mistaken for love, for the Queen is utterly self-absorbed and evilAnd when both women are equally attracted to the visiting Prince Alcott, the monarch decides to kill her rivalBut Brighton, the henchman told to dispatch the princess, can't bring himself to fulfil his task and lets her goAnd thus, deep in the forest, Snow White discovers a band of brigand dwarves who are only too happy to help her win the hand of her prince and depose her murderous stepmotherThere are some violent scenes (hence the PG rating), but the general tone is humorous, and the acting at times plays second fiddle to the astonishing set and costume design (Eiko Ishioka was posthumously Oscar-nominated for the Best Achievement in Costume Design).(n)</desc>

As the team's season begins, Annie selects brash new recruit Ebby Calvin Laloosh (Tim Robbins), whom she christens "Nuke," to inspire with the religion of baseball. Nuke also receives guidance from veteran player Crash Davis (Kevin Costner), who settles Nuke's erratic pitching and teaches him to follow the catcher's lead.(n)</desc>
