But the facility's attempt to keep the shark in captivity has dire consequences: A much larger mother shark appears in search of its offspring. Among those who must battle the angry aquatic killing machine are marine biologist Kathryn Morgan (Bess Armstrong), her co-worker Mike Brody (Dennis Quaid) and a pair of friendly dolphins.(n)</desc>
