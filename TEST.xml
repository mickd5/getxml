		<desc lang="en">Director Joe Carnahan's big-screen take, co-produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, on the 80s TV series, which was an OTT action-fest that, at the same time, gloried in and poked fun at its tough-guy stars and their adventures. This time around, a little brasher and more serious than their first incarnation, the team of soldiers comprises the cigar-chomping Col 'Hannibal' Smith, the wilfully eccentric Murdock, toned babe-magnet Face and, of course, BA Baracus, who famously 'pities the fool', usually with more forceful fisticuffing than is strictly necessary. Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar. And, of course, blowing up as many objects as possible along the way. Also featuring Jessica Biel as Face's former flame and Patrick Wilson as the team's CIA handler(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Dwayne Johnson stars in Michael Lembeck's family fantasy comedy about a tough-guy sportsman who learns the hard way not to puncture a child's illusions. Derek Thompson is an ice hockey pro whose main tactical use is the flattening of opponents - often depriving them of a tooth or two in the process. His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist in reality, he's in for a bit of a shock. Unknown to him they do - and they take great umbrage at his slight. Thompson is whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's tried for his misdemeanour and sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. Thus he sprouts wings, is furnished with an outfit completely at odds with his usual image and is given Tracy as a (none too willing) mentor. And, as the comedic misunderstandings and slapstick errors steadily mount, it's clear Thompson wasn't cut out for his new line of work(n)</desc>

Ben Stiller plays high school geek Ted, invited to the prom by the gorgeous Mary. He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private eye Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Love Happens (2009)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Jennifer Aniston and Aaron Eckhart star in Brandon Camp's directorial debut, which he co-wrote with long-time collaborator Mike Thompson. The romantic drama tells the story of Burke Ryan, who wrote a best-selling self-help manual following his wife's death in a car crash three years earlier. He's currently, under the guidance of his manager Lane, touring a seminar for the bereaved, which has brought him to Seattle, his late wife's hometown. And it's here, at his hotel, that he bumps into Eloise Chandler, the local florist who supplies the establishment's flowers. He's clearly taken with her, but she's quite frosty towards him. Even so, he pursues her - but It soon transpires that, despite his new career, both he and she have a lot of emotional baggage that will need to be dealt with before a relationship is likely to succeed. Also starring Martin Sheen and John Carroll Lynch. Edited for language(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Date Night (2010)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Tina Fey and Steve Carell star in Shawn Levy's chase comedy. Phil and Claire Foster feel their marriage has gone a tad stale and decide to pep it up by going out on a date, just like they used to do, before the kids and the mortgage and rest of life's inevitable distractions got in the way. In principal it's a good idea, but their first mistake is to attempt entry into one of Manhattan's swankiest restaurants without a reservation. Their second is far more serious: they bluff their way in, pretending to be a couple who have failed to show up for their table. Unfortunately for the Fosters, the absent diners have serious gangland connections. Even more unfortunately, the people whose identities they've adopted are due to be silenced forever by Mob hitmen. Cue a tightly plotted, gag-packed, headlong flight for survival, which has distinct echoes of the classics of the 40s screwball genre. And keep an eye out for memorable cameos from Mark Wahlberg and James Franco(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">North by Northwest (1959)</title>
		<desc lang="en">(1959) Alfred Hitchcock's classic thriller stars Cary Grant as Roger O Thornhill, an advertising executive mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies led by James Vandamm (James Mason). Though initially bemused, when Thornhill is accused of murdering a UN official he is forced to go on the run, aided by Vandamm's 'companion', Eve Kendall (Eve Marie Saint). As the double-crosses mount, he survives murderous attacks in both sophisticated auction rooms and by a crop-dusting plane in the deserted cornfields of the Midwest. He also learns of the importance his role has now taken in national security, leading to one of cinema's most memorable climaxes on the Mount Rushmore National Monument. M,W,S(n)</desc>
