		<sub-title lang="en">Land Rover Series I</sub-title>
		<desc lang="en">Philip Glenister and car designer Ant Anstead scour the barns and lock ups of Britain for wrecked treasures to bring to life. The Land Rover Series I is a seriously iconic British car. Born in 1948 it went on to conquer the world. Rugged, simple, but with only just 39,000 ever made, examples of this national treasure of automotive pride are getting harder and harder to find. It's down to Philip Glenister and internationally renowned car designer Ant Anstead to find, rescue and restore a Landie back to as good as new. Unfortunately the only example they can get their hands on has been sitting in a barn for over 41 years - un-driven, unloved and covered in cat poo. Philip meets the fanatical Landie lovers who eat, drink and sleep these cars - from trialers who gather in damp woods early on Sunday mornings to thrash their cars in the most basic form of motor sport, to a real life Lawrence of Arabia who depended on the Series 1 to keep him alive in the desert. And there's a flash mob where Philip and Ant's refurbed Landie is judged by the hardest critics of all - other Land Rover owners.(n)</desc>
