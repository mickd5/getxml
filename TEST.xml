Things go badly wrong for Richard the Lionheart and his men during their return from crusade in the Holy Land. One of the King's soldiers who escapes with his life is archer Robin Longstride, who adopts the persona of the recently slain Robin of Loxley in order to get back to the safety of England. Back on home soil, Robin makes his way to the Loxley estate in order to hand back the dead man's sword. But he's not only greeted with gratitude, he's also unexpectedly invited to continue living his double life, including cohabiting with Loxley's widow, the strong, independent Marion. It may look as though he's landed on his feet, but there's a dark cloud on the horizon in the form of the slippery, villainous Sir Godfrey - who is simultaneously out to squeeze more taxes from the population to fund the playboy lifestyle of Prince John, while also treacherously laying the ground for a second French invasion of Britain(n)</desc>

He persuades Balian that riches await those who go to defend the city and its Christian King Baldwin (Edward Norton) against the attack of Saladin (Ghassan Massoud), who seeks to win the city back for the Muslim faith. Balian, as well as falling for Baldwin's sister Sibylla (Eva Green), finds himself a power broker between the two factions, with the fate of the city in his hands.

		<title lang="en">Robin Hood (2010)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Russell Crowe, Cate Blanchett and Mark Strong star in director Ridley Scott's retelling of one of Britain's most enduring myths. Things go badly wrong for Richard the Lionheart and his men during their return from crusade in the Holy Land. One of the King's soldiers who escapes with his life is archer Robin Longstride, who adopts the persona of the recently slain Robin of Loxley in order to get back to the safety of England. Back on home soil, Robin makes his way to the Loxley estate in order to hand back the dead man's sword. But he's not only greeted with gratitude, he's also unexpectedly invited to continue living his double life, including cohabiting with Loxley's widow, the strong, independent Marion. It may look as though he's landed on his feet, but there's a dark cloud on the horizon in the form of the slippery, villainous Sir Godfrey - who is simultaneously out to squeeze more taxes from the population to fund the playboy lifestyle of Prince John, while also treacherously laying the ground for a second French invasion of Britain(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis star in Seth MacFarlane's irreverent and vulgar comedy-drama about the relationship between a man, a woman and the man's toy bear. The young John Bennett had such an unpleasant and lonely childhood that he wished his soft toy, Teddy, would come alive and be his friend. And to everyone's surprise it did. The walking, talking and wisecracking plush creature became an overnight sensation - even appearing on The Johnny Carson Show. But fame being what it is, Teddy's time in the limelight ended. Now, Bennett is a directionless slacker in his 30s and still inseparable from Ted. They share a fondness for booze and pot, but the cynical bear has also developed his own distinctive sexual peccadillos, which he indulges with prostitutes (while harbouring a deep resentment that he wasn't made with anatomical correctness). However, Bennett's emotional loyalty towards Ted faces its biggest test yet, in the shape of Bennett's girlfriend Lori. She feels Bennett needs to grow up - and choose between her and Ted. Meanwhile, the bear must deal with a fan who's stalking him(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Ted (2012)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis star in Seth MacFarlane's irreverent and vulgar comedy-drama about the relationship between a man, a woman and the man's toy bear. The young John Bennett had such an unpleasant and lonely childhood that he wished his soft toy, Teddy, would come alive and be his friend. And to everyone's surprise it did. The walking, talking and wisecracking plush creature became an overnight sensation - even appearing on The Johnny Carson Show. But fame being what it is, Teddy's time in the limelight ended. Now, Bennett is a directionless slacker in his 30s and still inseparable from Ted. They share a fondness for booze and pot, but the cynical bear has also developed his own distinctive sexual peccadillos, which he indulges with prostitutes (while harbouring a deep resentment that he wasn't made with anatomical correctness). However, Bennett's emotional loyalty towards Ted faces its biggest test yet, in the shape of Bennett's girlfriend Lori. She feels Bennett needs to grow up - and choose between her and Ted. Meanwhile, the bear must deal with a fan who's stalking him(n)</desc>
