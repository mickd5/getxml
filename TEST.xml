Jane Adler is the proprietor of a thriving bakery in a moneyed town in southern California.

Complications start to arise when Jane and Jake attend their youngest son's graduation ceremony; they have dinner together afterward, which leads ultimately to the bedroom.

The complexity in Jane's life deepens when charming architect Adam Schaffer appears on the scene. What's a woman to do? Pursue the excitement she's found with Jake, or opt for potential comfort with divorcé Adam? And will their lack of discretion lead to Jane and Jake being caught out in the meantime?(n)</desc>

Phil and Claire Foster feel their marriage has gone a tad stale and decide to pep it up by going out on a date, just like they used to do, before the kids and the mortgage and rest of life's inevitable distractions got in the way. In principal it's a good idea, but their first mistake is to attempt entry into one of Manhattan's swankiest restaurants without a reservation. Their second is far more serious: they bluff their way in, pretending to be a couple who have failed to show up for their table. Unfortunately for the Fosters, the absent diners have serious gangland connections. Even more unfortunately, the people whose identities they've adopted are due to be silenced forever by Mob hitmen. Cue a tightly plotted, gag-packed, headlong flight for survival, which has distinct echoes of the classics of the 40s screwball genre. And keep an eye out for memorable cameos from Mark Wahlberg and James Franco(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Despite nine years as partners, police detectives Jimmy (Bruce Willis) and Paul (Tracy Morgan) can still sometimes seem like polar opposites -- especially when Paul's unpredictable antics get them suspended without pay.

Unfortunately, the collector's shop is robbed by two small-time thieves and the detective loses his card.

The sun is dying, Earth suffers a perpetual winter and humanity's only hope is a spaceship that will deliver an atomic device into the heart of the Sun to 'kickstart' it again. Icarus II (Icarus I, the previous attempt, went missing years after launch) is captained by Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada), with Capa (Cillian Murphy), a physicist, and Corazon (Michelle Yeoh) in charge of the ship's environment. But as Icarus II approaches Mercury, it begins to receive signals from Icarus I, and when they board the supposedly lost craft, they encounter an entity that endangers the whole mission. Sunshine is written by Alex Garland, who also collaborated with Boyle on 28 Days Later. M,W,R,S,(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Get Him to the Greek (2010)</title>

Aaron Green (Hill) works for a record company run by the increasingly unhinged Sergio (Sean Combs) and is a huge fan of the British rock star Aldous Snow (Brand, reprising his role from Forgetting Sarah Marshall). Sergio and Green hatch a plan for Snow to play, in just three days' time, Los Angeles's revered venue the Greek Theatre. Getting Snow from London to LA, via New York and Vegas, should be a doddle. But he's just fallen off the wagon, and the sleazy rocker's appetite for drink, drugs and attractive women complicate the journey so much that it's not clear whether Green will survive the rock star's hedonism. In addition to Combs' superbly energetic turn, Rose Byrne shines as Jackie Q, a role that satirises the record industry's fondness for marketing its female artists as sexual commodities.

Each summer a bunch of greedy grasshoppers descends demanding food, which the peace-loving ants grudgingly supply. Then one year a rebel ant called Flik decides to enlist the help of an unemployed troupe of bug performers from a second rate flea circus to fight the intruders. It's a great idea, but doesn't quite work out the way he planned.... Star voices include Kevin Spacey and the late Roddy McDowall in this great family film. Ant-icipate enjoyment!(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Dirty Dancing (1987)</title>
		<desc lang="en">The late Hollywood heartthrob Patrick Swayze and Golden Globe nominee Jennifer Grey team up as dirty dance partners in this Oscar winning romantic classic. A teenage girl learns about love, adult responsibility, and how to do The Dirty Boogie. A teenage girl learns about love, adult responsibility, and how to do The Dirty Boogie in this romantic drama. In 1963, "Baby" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) is a 17-year-old spending the summer with her family at a resort hotel in the Catskills; she plans on being in the Peace Corps next summer, so this is expected to be her last summer as a carefree adolescent. Baby doesn't get along with her older sister, Lisa (Jane Brucker), and she's bored to tears by most of the older guests at the resort. However, one night Baby hears what sounds like a party going on in the employee's dormitory, and she pokes her head in to discover most of the hotel staff enjoying the sort of close dancing that would get you kicked out of the senior prom in no time flat. Baby is particularly struck by handsome Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), a dancer in the resort's floor show, and falls head over heels in love, wanting to be near him. Dirty Dancing was a surprise box-office hit, and the soundtrack album was an even bigger success, spawning several hit singles. Starring Patrick Swayze, Jennifer Grey &amp; Jane Brucker(n)</desc>
