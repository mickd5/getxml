Things go badly wrong for Richard the Lionheart and his men during their return from crusade in the Holy Land. One of the King's soldiers who escapes with his life is archer Robin Longstride, who adopts the persona of the recently slain Robin of Loxley in order to get back to the safety of England. Back on home soil, Robin makes his way to the Loxley estate in order to hand back the dead man's sword. But he's not only greeted with gratitude, he's also unexpectedly invited to continue living his double life, including cohabiting with Loxley's widow, the strong, independent Marion. It may look as though he's landed on his feet, but there's a dark cloud on the horizon in the form of the slippery, villainous Sir Godfrey - who is simultaneously out to squeeze more taxes from the population to fund the playboy lifestyle of Prince John, while also treacherously laying the ground for a second French invasion of Britain(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Date Night (2010)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Tina Fey and Steve Carell star in Shawn Levy's chase comedy. Phil and Claire Foster feel their marriage has gone a tad stale and decide to pep it up by going out on a date, just like they used to do, before the kids and the mortgage and rest of life's inevitable distractions got in the way. In principal it's a good idea, but their first mistake is to attempt entry into one of Manhattan's swankiest restaurants without a reservation. Their second is far more serious: they bluff their way in, pretending to be a couple who have failed to show up for their table. Unfortunately for the Fosters, the absent diners have serious gangland connections. Even more unfortunately, the people whose identities they've adopted are due to be silenced forever by Mob hitmen. Cue a tightly plotted, gag-packed, headlong flight for survival, which has distinct echoes of the classics of the 40s screwball genre. And keep an eye out for memorable cameos from Mark Wahlberg and James Franco(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Denzel Washington stars in this powerful and moving film about the early days of forced racial integration in the US, and how a high school football team helped bring in a new era of racial harmony. It's 1971. One all-white school and one all-black school have been forcibly merged, and a black coach appointed over the existing white football coach. It could be a recipe for disaster, but the two men shares certain qualities: integrity, honour and a strong work ethic. Together they mould a group of angry, disillusioned young men into a dynamic, winning football team - and provide a model for future integration. A top class film with a superb cast(n)</desc>

Derek Thompson is an ice hockey pro whose main tactical use is the flattening of opponents - often depriving them of a tooth or two in the process. His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist in reality, he's in for a bit of a shock. Unknown to him they do - and they take great umbrage at his slight. Thompson is whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's tried for his misdemeanour and sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. Thus he sprouts wings, is furnished with an outfit completely at odds with his usual image and is given Tracy as a (none too willing) mentor. And, as the comedic misunderstandings and slapstick errors steadily mount, it's clear Thompson wasn't cut out for his new line of work(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Despite nine years as partners, police detectives Jimmy (Bruce Willis) and Paul (Tracy Morgan) can still sometimes seem like polar opposites -- especially when Paul's unpredictable antics get them suspended without pay. Already strapped for cash, Jimmy decides to sell his rare baseball card to pay for his daughter's expensive wedding. Unfortunately, the collector's shop is robbed by two small-time thieves and the detective loses his card. With no other choice, Paul and Jimmy end up going rogue, tracking down the card and the drug ring behind its theft, all on their own time, and without any backup -- except for each other(n)</desc>

Freshly liberated, Boris sets out for long-brooded-upon revenge on Agent K who shot off his arm when he was captured. Time-travelling to the late 1960s, Boris intends to avoid his amputation, wipe Agent K from history and lead Earth's invasion by his race. Thus Agent J must also head back in time to prevent his friend's younger self from meeting an untimely death and the rest of us from being conquered...

		<desc lang="en">Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones return to reprise their roles in Barry Sonnenfeld's sci-fi action-comedy sequel about the agency that keeps Earth's human inhabitants blissfully oblivious to the pervasive existence of aliens. The film opens as homicidal extraterrestrial Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escaping a 40-year incarceration in a secret high-security prison on the moon. Freshly liberated, Boris sets out for long-brooded-upon revenge on Agent K who shot off his arm when he was captured. Time-travelling to the late 1960s, Boris intends to avoid his amputation, wipe Agent K from history and lead Earth's invasion by his race. Thus Agent J must also head back in time to prevent his friend's younger self from meeting an untimely death and the rest of us from being conquered... With Emma Thompson as Agent O, J and K's boss, and Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin, J's alien sidekick, who's capable of seeing every possible outcome in every situation(n)</desc>
