		<title lang="en">Date Night (2010)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Tina Fey and Steve Carell star in Shawn Levy's chase comedy. Phil and Claire Foster feel their marriage has gone a tad stale and decide to pep it up by going out on a date, just like they used to do, before the kids and the mortgage and rest of life's inevitable distractions got in the way. In principal it's a good idea, but their first mistake is to attempt entry into one of Manhattan's swankiest restaurants without a reservation. Their second is far more serious: they bluff their way in, pretending to be a couple who have failed to show up for their table. Unfortunately for the Fosters, the absent diners have serious gangland connections. Even more unfortunately, the people whose identities they've adopted are due to be silenced forever by Mob hitmen. Cue a tightly plotted, gag-packed, headlong flight for survival, which has distinct echoes of the classics of the 40s screwball genre.

Paradoxically, his code of honor gives him the backbone to survive as a military special forces operative when he is sent on a covert mission to rescue another group which was sent in to assist some nefarious U.S. government plan in a Latin American country. Once there, he encounters an old army buddy who has gotten too deep in the CIA's good graces for Dutch's comfort. When he and his team go into the jungle to rescue the others, they get involved in a pitched battle with local guerillas, but they are more than capable of besting these vicious fighters. However, not long after that, they encounter signs that the equally capable men they were sent to rescue were all killed unawares and in an unusually gruesome fashion. Given their training, it should have been impossible for anyone to best all of these commando warriors. Soon, the men from Dutch's own team get picked off one by one, as they grow aware that they are up against something uncanny, not of this world, something that is hunting them for sport. Why? Because their skills make them worthy opponents for the perfectly camouflaged Predator(n)</desc>

Tom Popper is a New York property shark with a failed marriage and a strained relationship with his kids. Popper's own father was an explorer, usually absent while Tom was growing up. That could be reason for Tom's emotional disengagement, but his father certainly is the reason Tom ends up receiving a crate of six gentoo penguins - a bequest from the old man's deathbed. Manhattan isn't the obvious place in which to care for the birds, but not only does Popper quickly bond with his charges, his adventures with them also act as a springboard for possible reconciliation with his family - as well as ample opportunity for Carrey to ply his trademarked rubber-faced, flexed-limbed comedic turn. The penguins are real ones, their antics only enhanced rather than generated by CGI.

		<desc lang="en">A hilariously criminal Santa finds a measure of holiday redemption when he befriends a troubled kid. The traditional Christmas tale will never be the same after this cleverly twisted, merrily irreverent story of a Santa so bad that he's funny. Billy Bob Thornton stars (in a Golden Globe-nominated role) as Willie T. Stokes, a washed-up, wisecracking department store Santa who is only in the business for the criminal opportunities. Every Christmas Eve this Santa and his ingenious Elf' Willie's midget partner-in-crime Marcus (Tony Cox), crack the store safe and make off with their own holiday stash. But this year Santa and his Elf find their annual heist endangered by a pesky store manager (John Ritter), a savvy mall detective (Bernie Mac), a sexy Santa fan (Lauren Graham) and an 8-year-old misfit (Brett Kelly) who decides to believe that Willie: intoxicated, acid-tongued and felonious as he is, is the real Santa(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">The network premiere of Michael Apted's family fantasy adventure, telling the continued adventures of the children who discovered a fantastical world hidden at the back of a wardrobe. In this third instalment of CS Lewis's enduring saga, Lucy and Edmund are transported back to the mystical land of Narnia while admiring what turns out to be an enchanted painting. Unfortunately for them, their self-centred, immensely irritating younger cousin Eustace was with them at the time, so he's along for the ride too. In Narnia, they meet King Caspian, who explains that a new malaise has crept across his kingdom, turning people's unpleasant imaginings into reality. This pandemic can only be reversed by rescuing banished allies and travelling to the Dark Isle to stem the evil at its source. So, it's all aboard Caspian's ship The Dawn Treader and off on a thrilling, scary expedition featuring dragons, ghosts, sea monsters and malevolent magic. Also starring Simon Pegg, Anna Popplewell, William Moseley, Liam Neeson and Tilda Swinton(n)</desc>

In this third instalment of CS Lewis's enduring saga, Lucy and Edmund are transported back to the mystical land of Narnia while admiring what turns out to be an enchanted painting. Unfortunately for them, their self-centred, immensely irritating younger cousin Eustace was with them at the time, so he's along for the ride too. In Narnia, they meet King Caspian, who explains that a new malaise has crept across his kingdom, turning people's unpleasant imaginings into reality. This pandemic can only be reversed by rescuing banished allies and travelling to the Dark Isle to stem the evil at its source. So, it's all aboard Caspian's ship The Dawn Treader and off on a thrilling, scary expedition featuring dragons, ghosts, sea monsters and malevolent magic. Also starring Simon Pegg, Anna Popplewell, William Moseley, Liam Neeson and Tilda Swinton(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Big (1988)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Academy Award winner Tom Hanks stars as Josh Baskin, a 12-year-old boy who is transformed into a 35-year-old man by a carnival wishing machine. When he wakes up to find that his wish to be "big" (in order to woo class beauty Cynthia Benson) has been mysteriously granted, Josh is confused and frightened at being thrust into an adult world for which he is utterly unprepared. When he gets his first job, with a toy company run by "Mac" Mac Millan (Robert Loggia), he discovers that being "big" as he always suspected, has definite advantages: freedom, money to spend, unlimited toys. But he is not prepared for what happens when he attracts the attention of a co-worker - - chic, ambitious Susan Lawrence, who makes Cynthia Benson look like...well, a little girl. Starring Tom Hanks &amp; Elizabeth Perkins(n)</desc>
