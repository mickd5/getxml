		<desc lang="en">Director Joe Carnahan's big-screen take, co-produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, on the 80s TV series, which was an OTT action-fest that, at the same time, gloried in and poked fun at its tough-guy stars and their adventures. This time around, a little brasher and more serious than their first incarnation, the team of soldiers comprises the cigar-chomping Col 'Hannibal' Smith, the wilfully eccentric Murdock, toned babe-magnet Face and, of course, BA Baracus, who famously 'pities the fool', usually with more forceful fisticuffing than is strictly necessary. Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar. And, of course, blowing up as many objects as possible along the way. Also featuring Jessica Biel as Face's former flame and Patrick Wilson as the team's CIA handler(n)</desc>

		<desc lang="en">Director Joe Carnahan's big-screen take, co-produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, on the 80s TV series, which was an OTT action-fest that, at the same time, gloried in and poked fun at its tough-guy stars and their adventures. This time around, a little brasher and more serious than their first incarnation, the team of soldiers comprises the cigar-chomping Col 'Hannibal' Smith, the wilfully eccentric Murdock, toned babe-magnet Face and, of course, BA Baracus, who famously 'pities the fool', usually with more forceful fisticuffing than is strictly necessary. Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar. And, of course, blowing up as many objects as possible along the way. Also featuring Jessica Biel as Face's former flame and Patrick Wilson as the team's CIA handler(n)</desc>

But she seems to thrive on his treatment and a reciprocal relationship begins until Spader, finding she enjoys the humiliation, fires her. Bereft, and with her boyfriend Jeremy Davies unable to fulfil her desires, she plans to win back Spader's affections. Steven Shainberg's film could have been crudely exploitative but thanks to the delicacy of his treatment, the subtlety of the two central performances, plus a leavening of humour, this is a story of unconventional love but love for all that(n)</desc>

Once there, he encounters an old army buddy who has gotten too deep in the CIA's good graces for Dutch's comfort. When he and his team go into the jungle to rescue the others, they get involved in a pitched battle with local guerillas, but they are more than capable of besting these vicious fighters. However, not long after that, they encounter signs that the equally capable men they were sent to rescue were all killed unawares and in an unusually gruesome fashion. Given their training, it should have been impossible for anyone to best all of these commando warriors. Soon, the men from Dutch's own team get picked off one by one, as they grow aware that they are up against something uncanny, not of this world, something that is hunting them for sport. Why?

		<title lang="en">Tooth Fairy (2010)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Dwayne Johnson stars in Michael Lembeck's family fantasy comedy about a tough-guy sportsman who learns the hard way not to puncture a child's illusions. Derek Thompson is an ice hockey pro whose main tactical use is the flattening of opponents - often depriving them of a tooth or two in the process. His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist in reality, he's in for a bit of a shock. Unknown to him they do - and they take great umbrage at his slight. Thompson is whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's tried for his misdemeanour and sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. Thus he sprouts wings, is furnished with an outfit completely at odds with his usual image and is given Tracy as a (none too willing) mentor. And, as the comedic misunderstandings and slapstick errors steadily mount, it's clear Thompson wasn't cut out for his new line of work(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Cloverfield (2008)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Matt Reeves' smart monster thriller has been favourably compared to The Blair Witch Project , with which it shares the concept of using "found" camcorder footage to reveal its horrors. The film opens at a party for Manhattan yuppie Rob Hawkins where the revelries are interrupted by a loud explosion. As he and his friends Hud, Jason, Marlena and Lily emerge onto the street, the head of the Statue of Liberty cartwheels past them. Something very big, scaly and angry is trashing the city, and one of the targets is a high-rise where Beth, Rob's girlfriend lives. The group set out in a rescue bid, with Hud recording everything as they make their way through what has become a nightmarish New York, threatened both by the monster (only ever half-glimpsed, making it even more terrifying) and the parasitic lice it sheds, which develop a taste for human flesh. Will all, or indeed any, of the group make it to safety? The footage tells their stories in shocking, handheld detail in this superbly paced movie(n)</desc>
