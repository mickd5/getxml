When the women of Rosman University's Theta Pi house throw a wild party, they set up Megan's boyfriend Garrett to think that he's overdosed her on a date-rape drug. Together, Garrett and Megan's friends Jessica, Chugs and Ellie take the 'corpse' off to a disused quarry for disposal. Unfortunately, at the quarry things don't go to plan and Megan is killed by accident. After a quick discussion, the shocked students decide to hide their friend's body and hope for the best. Eight months later it seems as though they have managed to get away with their crime. But, on the night of Theta Pi's graduation party, it becomes suddenly, violently clear that someone hasn't forgotten the sorority sisters' misdeed, and is out for bloody revenge on everyone involved in Megan's manslaughter(n)</desc>

Ben Stiller plays high school geek Ted, invited to the prom by the gorgeous Mary. He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private eye Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>

There, in the small, perpetually wintry town of Forks, she starts her new life, though she has no inkling of quite how different it's going to be. At her new school she quickly establishes herself as both a bit of a klutz and a hunk magnet. However, she's not interested in most of the guys - apart from the moodily handsome, ashen complexioned Edward Cullen. And when he saves her from various threatening situations, their mutual attraction is sealed. There's just one tiny problem: he's a vampire. But although Edward and his undead family are 'vegetarians' who don't feed on humans, his breed find it very difficult to control their overwhelming desire for human blood when their emotions switch from love to lust..(n)</desc>
