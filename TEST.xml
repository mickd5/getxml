This time around, a little brasher and more serious than their first incarnation, the team of soldiers comprises the cigar-chomping Col 'Hannibal' Smith, the wilfully eccentric Murdock, toned babe-magnet Face and, of course, BA Baracus, who famously 'pities the fool', usually with more forceful fisticuffing than is strictly necessary. Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar. And, of course, blowing up as many objects as possible along the way. Also featuring Jessica Biel as Face's former flame and Patrick Wilson as the team's CIA handler(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">There's Something About Mary (1998)</title>
		<desc lang="en">After Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin, this was the Farrelly brothers' breakthrough movie, an all-round, laugh-out-loud comedy of bad taste, leavened by stand-out performances from a top-notch cast. Ben Stiller plays high school geek Ted, invited to the prom by the gorgeous Mary. He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private eye Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>

The sun is dying, Earth suffers a perpetual winter and humanity's only hope is a spaceship that will deliver an atomic device into the heart of the Sun to 'kickstart' it again. Icarus II (Icarus I, the previous attempt, went missing years after launch) is captained by Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada), with Capa (Cillian Murphy), a physicist, and Corazon (Michelle Yeoh) in charge of the ship's environment. But as Icarus II approaches Mercury, it begins to receive signals from Icarus I, and when they board the supposedly lost craft, they encounter an entity that endangers the whole mission. Sunshine is written by Alex Garland, who also collaborated with Boyle on 28 Days Later. M,W,R,S,(n)</desc>
