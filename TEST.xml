He wants her for her unique green eyes, rare among Chinese women, to rejuvenate his spirit, and Burton has just hours to track down his lair and free Yin. With nods to the Indiana Jones trilogy, Carpenter enjoys setting up one exciting, exotic set piece after another while Russell wisely reprises the all-action, wise-cracking Snake Plissken from Escape from New York to enjoyable effect(n)</desc>

Kurt Russell plays Jack Burton, who agrees to pick up a friend's girlfriend from the airport. But when Miao Yin is kidnapped in front of him, Burton finds she's been abducted by sorcerer Lo Pan, the host of the spirit of an ancient Chinese warlord. He wants her for her unique green eyes, rare among Chinese women, to rejuvenate his spirit, and Burton has just hours to track down his lair and free Yin. With nods to the Indiana Jones trilogy, Carpenter enjoys setting up one exciting, exotic set piece after another while Russell wisely reprises the all-action, wise-cracking Snake Plissken from Escape from New York to enjoyable effect(n)</desc>

Back on home soil, Robin makes his way to the Loxley estate in order to hand back the dead man's sword. But he's not only greeted with gratitude, he's also unexpectedly invited to continue living his double life, including cohabiting with Loxley's widow, the strong, independent Marion.

Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar.

		<title lang="en">There's Something About Mary (1998)</title>
		<desc lang="en">After Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin, this was the Farrelly brothers' breakthrough movie, an all-round, laugh-out-loud comedy of bad taste, leavened by stand-out performances from a top-notch cast. Ben Stiller plays high school geek Ted, invited to the prom by the gorgeous Mary. He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private eye Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>

Derek Thompson is an ice hockey pro whose main tactical use is the flattening of opponents - often depriving them of a tooth or two in the process. His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist in reality, he's in for a bit of a shock. Unknown to him they do - and they take great umbrage at his slight. Thompson is whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's tried for his misdemeanour and sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. Thus he sprouts wings, is furnished with an outfit completely at odds with his usual image and is given Tracy as a (none too willing) mentor. And, as the comedic misunderstandings and slapstick errors steadily mount, it's clear Thompson wasn't cut out for his new line of work(n)</desc>

Two young Marines stand accused of murdering a member of their platoon during an unsanctioned disciplinary action known as a "Code Red". The Navy, in an effort to obtain a quick and quiet plea bargain, appoints Lieutenant J.G.Daniel Kaffee, a young, second generation Navy lawyer, to defend the accused Marines. Less than fifteen months out of Harvard Law School, Kaffee has earned a reputation for his glibness and facility to plea bargain. Though possessed of a brilliant legal mind Kaffee is more interested in softball games than in the hardball game of law. At first the game appears routine: On the U.S. Naval Base located at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, two Marines conduct a seemingly unauthorised punishment on a fellow Marine who has broken the chain of command by writing a letter to an off-base authority, threatening to report one of them for an illegal shooting over the fenceline in exchange for a transfer(n)</desc>

There, in the small, perpetually wintry town of Forks, she starts her new life, though she has no inkling of quite how different it's going to be.

And when he saves her from various threatening situations, their mutual attraction is sealed. There's just one tiny problem: he's a vampire. But although Edward and his undead family are 'vegetarians' who don't feed on humans, his breed find it very difficult to control their overwhelming desire for human blood when their emotions switch from love to lust..(n)</desc>

		<title lang="en">Twilight (2008)</title>
		<desc lang="en">Kristen Stewart stars in Catherine Hardwicke's winning adaptation of Stephenie Meyer's best-selling series of romantic fantasy novels about a teenage girl who falls in love with a vampire. When her mother remarries, Bella Swan relocates to the state of Washington to live with her father Charlie. There, in the small, perpetually wintry town of Forks, she starts her new life, though she has no inkling of quite how different it's going to be. At her new school she quickly establishes herself as both a bit of a klutz and a hunk magnet. However, she's not interested in most of the guys - apart from the moodily handsome, ashen complexioned Edward Cullen. And when he saves her from various threatening situations, their mutual attraction is sealed. There's just one tiny problem: he's a vampire. But although Edward and his undead family are 'vegetarians' who don't feed on humans, his breed find it very difficult to control their overwhelming desire for human blood when their emotions switch from love to lust..(n)</desc>
